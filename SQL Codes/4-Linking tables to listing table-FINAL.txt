/*The following statements connect our small tables to our major table (listings)
At the beginning, our listing table (major table) contained the id and related field for each 
For importing our data to the database, we created all of our small tables 
(whose primary keys are the foreign key of our transaction table) and imported their corresponding data.
 We also created our transaction table. If this table is supposed to have a column named prop_id,
 we also created a column named prop_name. Then we linked the data in the tables by putting a condition, as 
stated in the following codes. At the end, we will drop the column prop_name from our transaction table.*/
