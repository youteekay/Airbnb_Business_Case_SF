The Muni N-line will get you within a 6-minute walk, and is very convenient (with the exception of the hill), and is your second-best option. If you're fortunate enough to be driving a car, plenty of parking can be found on the street that circles Buena Vista park. There are always spots available, and as long as you avoid street cleaning (look for the signs) and you park no longer than 72 hours, you'll be good to go! Once you're here, walking or taxi is the best way to get around. See above (and the Guidebook) for more information. Pretty much everything is within a 20-minute walk."
There is tons of stuff within walking distance. A bunch of buses stop right near our house. The closest is the 21 which takes you right past Alamo Square to downtown. Its a half block away.
"Parking is usually available in the immediate neighborhood. Be mindful of the street sweeping signs. For two hours each week you will get ticketed for parking in a street sweeping zone. On Haight parking is available without a permit. These tend to be the spots that go first.  Head in parking. On Waller, just south of Haight running parallel and on Baker there is head-in parking which creates plenty of spaces. Baker Street and the side of Buena Vista park are also head-in parking but with permits required for day parking.  If you park in a permit area overnight, you still have two hours from the start of the day to park for free. So you can stay in a permit zone until 10am in the morning, then move your car.  In practice, they rarely ticket for permit violations, but always ticket for street sweeping violations and often ‚Äúwheel not turned in‚Äù.  Paid Lot. If you cannot find any street parking there is a paid lot in the DMV parking lot on Broderick between Oak and Fell. Go two blocks nor"

"I do not offer a parking spot, but the apartment is extremely close to public transportation (the ""N"" line on Stanyan/ Carl streets), which is easy, cheap and plentiful.  However, if you're driving, it's a fairly easy neighborhood to find free parking in.   However, while parking is free, it is not unlimited.  They ticket every two hours from 8 am to 5 pm Monday through Friday, so you need to either move your car by 10 am (not too hard, there are usually spots to be found, and most people start their day by then anyway), or park in a parking lot (Kezar Parking Lot is nearby, and you can pay to park all day for ~$20-~25 for 24 hours, should you want to leave your car there for a day or more).  There are also some streets nearby (Rivoli street, for example) where you can park round the clock for ~48 hours for free and they don't ticket, but you have to search a bit for those spots as everyone wants them!"

Airport Shuttle - this will cost $17 for the first person and $12 for each additional traveler. Don't forget to add tip for the driver. 3. Public Transportation - BART and Muni - Cost: $10.25 per person and it takes about one hour. Of course the most convenient option is taking a cab. But if you want to save some money I would suggest the shuttle. But remember, you might have to wait a bit for the van to fill up and since it is a shared ride there may be several stops on the way to unload other passengers.

San Francisco is a great walking city.  Note, that parking can be a challenge in our neighborhood, especially on weekends and nights.

There is parking 3 blocks away at Buena Vista Park which does not have 2-hour parking restriction Monday - Friday like on our street. We are unable to provide parking permit for guests."
"The apartment is close to buses that take you downtown (21, 5, 6, 7), or south into the Castro or Noe (21), or north to the Marina (21). The Haight, Castro, Nopa, and Hayes Valley are all within pleasant walking distance. Parking is hard to come by throughout San Francisco -- in most neighborhoods you can't park at all without a permit for that neighborhood. Luckily, one street to the south of my apartment, there's parking available without a permit. If you must bring a car, my suggestion is to find a parking spot and leave the car there for the duration of your visit. Between buses and Uber, you really don't need a car in the city. If you can avoid renting one altogether, you will be much happier! For day trips, the best thing to do is sign up for Getaround (URL HIDDEN) There are dozens of cars available in the neighborhood on a moment's notice for under $10 an hour, many with cheaper day rates."

We urge guests to take uber and the bus around the city, avoid renting a car! YOU DO NOT EVER leave ANYTHING in your car in SF ever, there are too many crack heads doesn't matter what neighborhood. Don't leave yourself vulnerable, ALWAYS read the signs for street cleaning, tow away and limitations and curb your wheels, even the slightest down or uphill grade can be a major ticket. The neighborhood requires an L permit and you can contact the SFMTA about how to get a residential permit including a temporary pass.   That means that any where in the City where a permit is required, between 8 am and 6pm its 2 hour parking. So you can move the car around i"

There are buses going downtown every 5-10 minutes on the other side of the street (Post and Jones). Cable car right on Powell street.  Parking is an issue in the city, so if you have a car I wouldn't recommend staying here. Street parking is very hard to find.

Street parking can be a challenge but there are multiple parking garages in the areas (O'ffarell Street Garage has the best rates).

Also one block away from many bus lines on Market Street, namely the F Streetcar, which takes you to the Ferry Building and down Embarcadero.

It also has stops for Muni and BART which are 2 of the 3 main public transit systems that can take you to anywhere in the city and Bay Area. This place really is in the heart of San Francisco! Since the place is in a very cultural neighborhood, paid street parking spots are available but difficult to find. The use of public transport or shared private cars like Uber and Lyft is highly recommended."

I think it's less expensive than Uber.)"

The BART is about a 15 minute walk from here. This neighborhood is also excellent if you work in Silicon Valley and take a commuter bus, because there are many  commuter bus stops in Noe Valley.   You can always park (for free) within a block of the building.  If you have a car or intend to rent one, this is an ideal property for that.  We encourage you to explore the Bay Area by car if that is an option.  Unlike most other San Francisco neighborhoods both the 280 and 101 Freeways are within easy access (5 minutes).  The SFO airport is only 18 minutes by car from this residence."
"Easy access to the J-Church MUNI line and 48 bus line provide access to downtown and other neighborhoods.  Easy access for Uber, taxes etc. Walking distance (10 minutes) downhill to the Noe Valley 24th St."
"35, 48 buses or J Church (rail) run near by and provide quick transportation to BART Parking for anyone who has a car is easy on this street."
"Muni J Line is literally out the front door and you're off to 24th street, Deloris park and downtown in minutes. Board at 27th & Church and $2.25 adult fare allows transfers to other lines for several hours. Fun."
The 48 bus passes in front of the house which will take you to the 24th Street Bart Station. Can also walk to the Castro MUNI station (walking up the hill can be a good work out even though its only about a 10 minute walk).
MUNI is 4 blocks away. There are other bus lines too that are 2 blocks away. Easy cab access too as they are always cruising around the Castro.
"Car Rental ZipCar is closest to the building, with 3 locations at: Castro and Jersey St., Diamond and Elizabeth St., and 26th and Noe St. (SF) City Car Share has a location nearby at Castro and 24th St. You have the option to lease available vehicles from people through ridesharing apps Getaround and RelayRides, or can navigate the city quickly from this location via Uber and Lyft (average wait time on Uber is 5 minutes).

"Bus lines 24, 35 and 48 are alle within a block or two and so is the metro (muni) J-line. The BART is 15min away and takes you to the East Bay or South Bay via Caltrain. Highway 101 and 280 are very easy to access from the apartment."
"Public transportation is nearby.  You are one block from several different bus lines and three blocks from the J Church Muni which brings you downtown and to the Embarcadero.  The Glen Park BART station and the 24th St BART stations are also close by.  If you are coming from SFO, there are numerous ground transport options, or if you take BART to the Glen Park station, you are a short taxi, Uber or Lyft ride away.  I DO NOT recommend taking the bus from the Glen Park Station.  If two of you are traveling together, I recommend a taxi over a shuttle from SFO as it should cost $44 and the shuttle service will be $27."
"WALK WALK WALK! This is what makes our location so special - you can walk to so many places. We are also close to bus lines 35, 24 and 48 which gets you to most places - including the Bart (which gets you to the East bay) and MUNI underground which takes you downtown."
Get the (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) Maps app for your phone.  IT is great for driving directions and is really GREAT at getting you around by bus etc.  Buses stop right at corner for access to BART and SF Municipal Railway.  Uber is also great.  I also recommend the app DETOUR as a constant tour guide as you wander through the city.
"The 48, 35,  24 bus lines are all a few blocs down 24th street.  The J Church metro to downtown San Francisco stop is located on Church and 24th. Uber and Lyft are other convenient alternative ways of getting around."
"The 48 bus stops across the street. The 35 bus stop is one block away, and the 24 is two blocks away. The 24th St BART station is ~12 blocks away on the 48 bus line - or have a nice walk from there through Noe Valley.  "
"Buses are right around the corner and will take you downtown, and to other public transit options. The Castro MUNI is a 10 minute walk."
Easy access to public transportation. Parking is plentiful in the area. Several bus lines within walking distance.

"24th Street, the heart of Noe Valley, is half a block away.  Whole Foods and Walgreens, coffee shops, restaurants, books stores and boutiques are all within a 2-3 minute walk.   For venturing out of the the neighborhood, we're centrally located and just a few steps to public transportation.  Downtown is 20 minutes away by the J-Church train that stops a block away, and the 24th & Mission BART station is a 10 minute walk.  The tech buses that go to several well-known Silicon Valley companies stop right around the corner.  Since the neighborhood has a lot of single family homes with garages, 2 hour street parking is relatively easy for San Francisco.  There are also some coveted all day street parking spots within 2 blocks.   "
"Three bus lines within 2 blocks. If you are coming from either airport on BART, get off at 24th st. Transfer to muni bus #48 which winds through downtown Noe Valley and up the hill to Diamond Heights, getting off at Clipper and Diamond Height Blvd. walk across the street, and down along Clipper a short way to carnelian Way. I'm down the hill, past parking area."
Muni stop is 2 blocks away; easy access to all of San Francisco.   24th Street and Mission BART stop is a 10 minute walk.
"Closest BART is Glen Park Station and connects via Bus 52 (@ Duncan and Diamond Heights Blvd) It is also nearby 2 additional bus stations for Bus 48 (@ Clipper St and Diamond Heights Blvd) and Bus 37 (EMAIL HIDDEN) Av and Portola/Market Street), which brings you right into the heart of the Castro.

"Conveniently located just 1/2 block to Muni 24 bus stop that runs regularly all day and night. 2 1/2 blocks from J-Church street car line.  If one needs to go to East Bay, Peninsula or SFO, BART can be used. Closest station is Glen Park, a one mile walk or can Muni to most downtown underground stations and transfer to BART. Close to all tech bus routes. If driving, easy access to Highway 101 and 280 and there is plenty of available free street parking. No permit required so you can park all day. Be aware of street cleaning days, signs are posted but it's the 2nd and 4th Tuesday on our side of the street from 8am-10am and Friday on the other side of the street. Cars must be moved during those times. Uber and Lyft friendly."
"There are two main forms of Public Transit within two blocks, the J Muni Train, and the 24 Muni Bus.  You can get to the Bart via the J train and 48 Bus in 15 minutes, or go downtown on the J train in 15 minutes.  The 24 Bus brings you to Pacific Heights via Divisadero Street."

"Walk to public transportation (MUNI above ground, BART subway);   Shared rides (Uber, Lyft);  Corporate shuttle buses;    Central location makes it easy to commute to all the popular attractions and neighborhoods (Mission District;   Castro District;  Downtown;  Financial District;  North Beach/Little Italy;  Fisherman's Wharf;  Alcatraz,  Telegraph Hill;  Chinatown;  Golden Gate Park; Haight Ashbury;  Lands End; Clift House; Seal Rocks; etc."
There is plenty transportation around this house.  There is a cable car that goes to downtown SF every 15 minutes from the corner of the house.  Also there is a Bart (Metro) about 8 minutes walk from the house. Buses are all over.
"The J-line of the Muni (light rail, significantly cleaner and more modern than BART) goes directly to the Powell Street station in 20 minutes. The stop is 2 short blocks away, directly down a gentle hill on 29th and Church. (~3 min walk). Powell Street is within few blocks of the key venues for Dreamforce, including the Intercontinental, the Moscone Center, the Hilton Union Square and Park Central. Ubers are plentiful nearby, typically arrive within 3-4 minutes of calling and would cut the 20 minute trip ~in half."
"Lyft and ridesharing have changed the way we get around...we use it a lot, and recommend it highly.   If you aren't using Lyft yet, get credit towards your first ride (amount changes, currently $15): load the app, and put in code ANDY4211 in 'promotions'.  Same deal with Uber, use code u8e7n in the ""promotions"" tab for a similar credit...but we prefer Lyft for it's fairness to drivers and ability to tip from the app .  That said, lots of public transportation nearby: 3 bus lines within 2 blocks (lines 24, 35 and 48), streetcar 6 blocks away (J-Church),  pop over to the Castro Street station on foot (about 15 minutes) for access to almost the entire underground system, easy access to BART with a short transfer on the very frequent 48 bus.  Nearby Freeway access in all directions, 5-8 minutes to 101 and 280 (north and south), be on the Golden Gate Bridge in less than 20 minutes.  Less than 20 minutes to SFO."

This makes getting around town a breeze without a car. Street parking is also available. You‚Äôll find the Noe Valley is the type of neighborhood you‚Äôll want to spend time relaxing in. Loads of enchanting, eye-popping Victorian homes adorn the neighborhood. Numerous restaurants, cute apparel shops, grocery and convenience stores are just steps away.

We recommend exploring Noe Valley on foot. It is a safe, well-lit, police patrolled, up-scale neighborhood that is pedestrian friendly."
One of the main bus lines in the city stops right outside the door: the 24-Divisadero will take you N/S through SF.  Just a few blocks away is the 29-Sunset which will take you east into Mission or west to the Sunset. The J-Line is a muni metro nearby that can quickly take you downtown and connect you to BART to access the greater Bay Area.
"Bus stops and trams are a short walk away and can virtually take you any corner of the city. The closest Bart station is 1 mile away on 24th and mission, a walk through Noe and the heart of the historic mission district. Also, we are a few minutes away from access to 280, which is perfect for business travelers or a couple who may want to explore the rest of beautiful bay area!"

"You can catch the 48 bus on the corner to the 24th and Mission streets where you can hang out with the locals, grab a beer and some food or hear some great music. If you rent a bike and are not feeling the 5 block uphill ride back home, you can pick up the 35 bus at Castro and Market and it'll drop you off right here at the corner. If you're renting a car to explore outside the city, you'll find street parking easy when the day is over -- we're at the top of a hill so only neighbors park in the hood. With the Castro Street subway station just a 10 minute stroll downhill, you're a ride away from Union Square shopping, the farmers market at The Ferry Building, or an afternoon game at AT&T Park."

"Ridiculously convenient to public transit, the 35-Eureka bus stop to Glen Park BART & Castro Station MUNI is literally steps from the apartment.  Hop on and off with ease.     The Noe Valley 24th St. corridor is about a 10 min walk down the hill.  There you will find restaurants, shops, Whole Foods & nightlife.  From there you can catch the 48-Quintera-24th Street bus to Ocean Beach & Dogpatch.   Additionally, the J-Church, 24-Divisidero & 52-Excelsior, are close by as well. There is ample street parking available on the block, much of it with million dollar views of the city and Bay.  But pay attention to the  posted street cleaning schedules to avoid a ticket."
MUNI runs in front of the house & runs till late night.  BART is 10 min walk or can take a MUNI to BART. You can rent bikes with us You can rent scooters in the neighborhood You can rent cars using Get Around in the neighborhood
Yes. Just around the corner is the J Church to downtown and financial district. Bart underground is 10 minutes walk. Both major freeways (280 and 101) are very close. 
"Our place has a 91% walk score, and you don't really need a car to get around.  24th Street, the heart of Noe Valley, is three blocks away. Whole Foods grocery store, Walgreens drug store, coffee shops, restaurants, book stores, boutiques, and the Church & 24th MUNI train stop are all well within a 10-minute walk.  The heart of the Castro neighborhood is just four blocks away in the other direction with several markets, bars, clubs, restaurants, the Castro MUNI train station, and the historic Castro movie theater also all within a 10-minute walk. For venturing out of the the neighborhood, we're only a block away from  the nearest public transportation. The 35 bus will whisk you to the Castro MUNI train station in 5 minutes, then downtown is only 20 minutes away.  Take the 35 bus in the opposite direction to get to the Glen Park BART station to reach the SFO or OAK airports. The tech buses that go to several well-known Silicon Valley companies stop about a 5-minute walk down 24th Street"
"Depending on where you go in SF having a car is not always necessary.  If you go to Downtown I‚Äôd recommend taking the J line from Church street/30th. The stop is a couple of blocks away from the house, down the hill. You can go all the way to Embarcadero on the J line in 20 minutes.  J-line schedule:((website hidden))  24th bus route stops on Noe and 29th, two blocks away from the house and goes through Castro, Haight Street."
"We are centrally located in San Francisco within 2  blocks of bus lines leading to BART or the underground Muni.  There is FREE unrestricted street  parking on the surrounding blocks, except for street cleaning days twice per month. (a rare find in this city!)"
"It is very conveniently located just 1 block to a municipal bus stop that runs regularly all day and night. You can buy a muni card at Walgreens which is just two blocks away that you can use for the transportation system throughout the city. If you are renting a car, there is plenty of available street parking on the street the cottage is located. "
"Walking distance from 24th St BART subway and J-Church streetcar line. Close to BART and Muni J-Church streetcar line.  Both will bring you downtown, BART is much faster but the streetcar is scenic and has views of Dolores Park. Explore by foot if you can, so many pretty streets around. The 280 HWY and 101 HWY are in fairly close proximity. For a variety of reasons the city is better explored without a personal auto. While parking is usually available within a block, especially before 5pm, you must be careful about any posted restrictions for street sweeping or 2-hr residential permit time limits (Mon-Sat 8-6pm, excluding holidays) which you'll need to move your car every 2hrs or get a temporary permit, or find a nearby neighborhood without 2hr limits using SFMTA's zone map. Please let me know ASAP if you'll have a car as you'll need to wait in line and buy a temporary parking permit from the city's transportation office; I'll give you the details you'll need to do so."
"Less than a block away ( 20 steps) to the J Muni line, and the Glen Park BART station is within a mile. The 280 and the 101, the main freeways are within a mile, and there is plenty of wine bars, coffee shops and restaurants within walking distance. If you have a car, there is street parking but you may have to park a few blocks away, although parking is easier in this hood than in most others in the city."
Muni runs on either corner of our block. The 24 Muni runs approx every 8 minutes to Market St where you can take a train anywhere muni runs. You are 18 minutes to Downtown and Union square by Muni.
"Public transportation from our home is quick and easy. We are close to the J-Church streetcar and the 24 and 48 bus lines making it an easy commute to anywhere in San Francisco including downtown, the Embarcadero, the Ferry Building, SOMA and ATT Park. Go Giants! It‚Äôs close enough to walk to the 24th Street Bart station to be connected to the airport, the Peninsula, downtown San Francisco, Berkeley and towns further out in the East Bay. Numerous tech buses can also be found in the neighborhood."
Our home is located 1 block from the 24 bus line that cuts across the city and 3 blocks to the J Muni line that goes through the mission toward downtown and the embarcadero.
"We are in the perfect location! 1/2 block from the MUNI 48, 2 blocks from the MUNI J-Church, and 4 uphill blocks from BART. Uber, Lyft, and taxis all show up quickly to our home; and car sharing with GetAround, City Carshare, RelayRides, and Zipcar are all nearby as well."
"- Lyft/Uber/Cabs:  This is definitely the most efficient way of getting around the city! With a Lyft app on your phone, you can get to several popular destinations in the city for $6-10 on 'Lyft Line'. - 511: Please check out the Trip Planner on 511.org f"

2 blocks to J-Church (MUNI) 8 blocks to BART
"There are MUNI bus lines steps away from the front door. One goes to a MUNI Metro subway stop for a quick ride downtown. Another runs straight to the Mission (great food) and to a BART station for getting either downtown or across the Bay to Berkeley and Oakland, and to the SF (and Oakland) airports.  The Castro is only 7 blocks from the house but it‚Äôs over a massive hill. Fortunately, the bus goes there! By car: Street parking, with side-of-street street cleaning restrictions, but no residential permit required, unlike many other neighborhoods. (No parking allowed in driveway, please.) Uber and Lyft are also great in this neighborhood."
"The cottage is within seconds to the J train stop, which goes directly to San Francisco downtown and financial district in 15 minutes, passing through Dolores Height, Dolores Park (with great view, don't miss it), Castro, and Debuce triangle. It is also within ~15 minutes walk to the 24th st. BART station (goes directly to SFO and the east bay i.e. Berkeley, Oakland etc...) and Mission district. Mission is arguably the most trendy neighborhood in San Francisco - lots of trendy restaurants, coffee shops, shops and the latest bar and food scenes are tightly concentrated in this district. Within ~8 minutes walk, Dolores Park (one of the most favored public park by San Franciscans) and the famously liberal Castro neighborhood are within reach.  Corporate shuttles to South Bay are extremely accessible from the cottage.  Other public transportation such as 48, 24 bus lines provide access to different parts of the city. For those who are not interested in having a car (highly encouraged due t"
"Getting around is very easy. The house is close to several types of transit: Bus: 24, 48 Muni: J BART: 24th st station"
The 35 bus literally picks up right outside your doorstep. Castro muni can be reached after a few min on the bus or is a ten min walk away. Private garage gives you flexibility if you want a car for day trips and exploring. 
We are a lovely 15 minute walk to BART.  Very close to MUNI/several main lines of public transportation. This is a major stop area for Silicon Valley buses.
"From our home you can find easy parking, or take the bus, BART, Muni, or simply walk wherever you need.  Noe Valley is a very central location that will help you access any place in the city without trouble with or without a car."
"A multitude of great restaurants, coffee shops and a grocery store are all within a blocks and a half.   The 24 and 48 bus meets less than 100 feet away on 24 and Castro.  The J train meets 2 blocks away and can get you anywhere in the city including fisherman's wharf! Uber is fantastic and is our preferred method!"
Park your car or take a bus. Both are very easy so you have choices!
I am 8 blocks walk from the Castro muni station which can get you to union square in ~10 minutes.
Noe Valley is central within San Francisco. So most sights are accessible from there - feel free to ask us how to get around. There are many alternative to traditional taxis and transportation in San Francisco (like Lyft or Uber).
"The J metro line is three blocks away (5-7 minutes walking) and can take you to downtown and back easily.  Bus #24 is half a block away and is another really fast way to get to Noe Valley, Castro and from there to downtown"
"San Francisco is a very accessible city.  There is street parking if you have a car with you.  Also, the J-Church line (cable car) stops 1/2 block away and BART is a 15-minute walk."
Easy street parking and close public transportation. 
It's right outside the door on a main MUNI line that runs every 8 or 12 minutes. With Routsey Free you can get where you are going hassle free! 
"There is a metro line on our block - it is 15 min to downtown, and you can download an app or go online to see when the next ones are arriving. It's quite accurate (pretty much to the minute) and it's easy to plan a trip. We use the metro to go downtown all the time, since it much more convenient than driving (parking is hard and traffic is horrible). If you are staying for several days, you can purchase a Clipper card to ride the metro. Clipper cards are found at the local Walgreens, which is located on the corner of 24th Street and Castro Street, which is a short walk from our place. You may also download a Lyft or Uber app on your iPhone, which are both transportation services,  if you don't want to take the Metro.  We are just a few blocks away from 24th Street, what the locals call the Noe Valley Village. This is a vibrant street full of great shops, cafes, restaurants, and a Whole Foods, for your grocery needs.  We have a map ready for you when you arrive, so you know all the bes"

"There is no parking provided, however there is street parking available. MUNI Bus 24 comes right to the street corner,  Mission/24th St. BART station is not far at all."
"WARNING! If you have any mobility issues please consider this location carefully. We are up a steep hill, better than 17% grade on the last half block. That's why the views are spectacular. It's only a half block to the nearest bus stop but it's a steep half block.       Walk everywhere! We have a 74 WalkScore and excellent transit connectivity. Refer to our guidebook which highlights our favorite walk-to destinations. The Diamond Heights Shopping center (Safeway, Walgreens and Bank of America) is an easy three blocks away. Six blocks down hill is the much more fun 24th Street ""Heart of Noe Valley"" with world-class cafes, restaurants, bars, bistros, shopping, Whole Foods, and a Saturday Farmers Market. 24th Street continues into the sunny Mission. The Valencia Corridor offers some of the hippest cycling, foodie and entertainment scenes in the west. It's a short but hilly 15 - 20 min walk from our home to the Castro, about a mile (1.6k). Ask me the best routes to walk to the top of Twin"

For those coming from the airport this place is perfect, just a short UBER rider or BART trip.

And our block does not require neighborhood parking permit stickers so you may park your car on the street for the duration of your stay (read signs for street cleaning exceptions)."
"We are in a great location for easy access to freeways.  And although you can find all you probably need within our own little neighborhood, you will of course want to venture downtown.

"Helpful suggestion for having the best time in San Francisco -- please, don't rent a car!  Traffic and parking are difficult everywhere in San Francisco. Our neighborhood is one of the least difficult to park in, but it's still the city and so there is limited parking, even here.  Cabs and ride-sharing are easily available at all hours, and the 1 California trolley (that stops right across the street) runs the full length of the city from Land's End to the Ferry Building with easy access to the Fillmore District, Chinatown, North Beach, The Financial District and the Embarcadero, with connections to the myriad neighborhoods that make San Francisco such a fabulous city to spend time in.  In our neighborhood (known as the Richmond District) we are within walking distance of the Golden Gate Bridge (a must-do is a walk across the bridge), Golden Gate Park, Baker Beach, the Legion of Honor Museum and the DeYoung Museum with fantastic permanent collections and extraordinary exhibitions.

"I only drive in San Francisco if it's absolutely necessary. The city is crowded and parking is expensive. Some guests exclusively use Uber or Lyft. Use a Clipper card.

The closest is a block from the apartment.  All public transportation have card readers and it's an easy way to get around, instead of carrying cash or change.

"This home has a 68 Walk Score (Somewhat Walkable: Some errands can be accomplished on foot), 77 Transit Score (Excellent Transit: Transit is convenient for most trips) and a 60 Bike Score (Somewhat Bikeable: Very steep hills, excellent bike lanes).

Although San Francisco is a small city (only 11km by 11km - or 7 miles by 7 miles) in size, commute times are often long due to the need to change buses and navigate heavy traffic (our subway is very limited so most public transport is done by bus).

"DO NOT BRING A CAR! Parking Meters are $6/hr, the parking lot across the street charges $15-25/day, and typically $25/-30 all-day (with no in/out privileges). Its 2-Hour maximum for street parking from 8AM-6PM Monday-Saturday if you're lucky starts align with the planets of this and every near Solar System...what I'm getting at is parking you car (let alone driving it) is a biatch in this neighborhood and every single other neighborhood in San Francisco thats worth visiting!  You're far better off just taking Lyft Line or Uber Pool wherever you go. From SFO its typically $30-40 and its typically $7 in the city. Go online/ the app for rates. Shipping and Handling is an additional $9.95 (kidding!) BART & MUNI are easily accessed and utilized for those familiar with public transit but to be honest ride sharing is way easier. Also renting a bike is a great way to see the city  (that is not a joke)."

ZipCar: There are a half dozen zip car locations within a half-mile of the house. If you have a membership, it's a great deal at $7-$15 an hour including gas and insurance. Look them up for short term. Enterprise rent a car has a facility at 13th and Mission and if you call ahead they will come pick you up for your rental free of charge.  Use this for rentals over 4 hours, i.e., 24 hour units. There is parking at the house for $15 a day.  It is off street and very safe."

It‚Äôs a quick 15mins to downtown. - There are usually cabs on Mission St or Valencia St.  Many San Franciscans use the ‚ÄúLyft‚Äù mobile app. - I may have some secure space to store a bicycle at the house if you rent/bring one.

"24th & Mission BART station is two blocks away. From SFO, take BART almost to my doorstep!"
"We are two blocks away from the nearest BART Station (16th St. BART), half a block away from the nearest bus stop, and there is free street parking nearby.

33 Bus transport is right at the corner and the BART  is a quick 15 minute walk  at the intersection of Misson Street and 24th.  There are several bus lines which intersect along 24th.   It is a free call to cellnumber311 to obtain directions from city info.

(The Mission is a great biking neighborhood - very few hills & generally flat!) Parking - there is free, first come, first serve street parking on the street our house is on.  (I'd avoid driving in SF unless absolutely necessary though. It typically takes longer than public transportation - which is plentiful -  and parking can be stressful and/or expensive.)"

"This city is 100% walkable, and very accessible by public transit (bus, subway, streetcar, and train). We recommend enjoying SF without the stress, expense, and pollution of a car. There is NO parking on the premises. There is LIMITED street parking in our neighborhood, but be mindful of parking time/day regulations in the city, because they can be confusing! There are also parking garages available throughout the neighborhood at about $20-50/day. We are just two blocks from the 16th Street & Mission St. BART station, and we are close to many buslines as well. Lyft and Uber are super available here, as are many different taxi services. The 16th Street BART station is a little gritty, and gives a bad first impression of the neighborhood, but rest assured that the rest of the neighborhood is lovely and safe."

"The location is convenient to BART, MUNI, and 101."
Just one block from 24th and Mission BART station. Very easy airport access.
"One of the great features of this location is the access to multiple forms of public transportation and also the freeway. You can use online mapping software to figure out how to get around using the BART (subway), the bus, or if you are traveling south out of the city, the Caltrain. If you use a carsharing service like Zipcar or Getaround, those services have plenty of cars in the neighborhood. Of course, since I live here, I can answer any questions you have about getting around. Additionally, it is very easy to get to our apartment from the SFO airport. You can either take the BART (takes 30-45 minutes and costs $8.80 per person) or a taxi service such as Lyft or Uber (takes 15-45 minutes, depending on traffic and costs $15-40, depending on demand)."

What is fabulous about our location, though, is that it is walking distance to a"

If you do have a car, free on-street parking is available.  However, there is a 2-hour parking limit for non-resident vehicles from 8am to 9pm Monday through Friday.  That means you need to move your car every two hours during the day.  Nights are easier -- if you park you car after 7pm you can leave it there until 10am the next morning. All that being said, temporary parking permits are available.  They eliminate the 2-hour restriction so that you can park in the neighborhood all day.  Please contact us for availability and pricing."

Very conveniently located next to 24th Street BART station and several bus lines.
Everything you need is within walking distance.  Public transportation is close and easy.  I can help you with it.
Our area is one of the easiest places to get around.   There is all day street parking in front (not metered) and we are 2 blocks from the BART station making it a 10 minute commute to shopping downtown - it's only 3 stops away.   We are also 10 minutes driving from the airport and right off the freeway exit.  It couldn't get any easier.
"3 blocks from BART, 2 bus stops within 1/2 a block and Zipcar is in our backyard."
We're just blocks away from the BART - the main train system in San Francisco (and really just blocks! takes fewer than 5 minutes to get to a train!).

Bart is 2.5 blocks away on 16th and mission.  The 33 (2 blocks away) heads straight out to the ocean.  19 minutes to airport.  Hard pressed to find a better transit locale.
"The J-Church Muni Metro (streetcar) is 1.5 blocks away. It will take you downtown or you can transfer to other streetcars or buses to go wherever you want in San Francisco. The BART train (subway) station is 6 blocks away. Take BART to downtown San Francisco, across the Bay to Oakland or Berkeley, or south to San Francisco Airport (SFO). The private buses that take workers to Silicon Valley tech companies stop within a couple of blocks of the apartment. "

"San Francisco is a very walkable city, but if you need transportation, our location provides a lot of options. We are a block away from the 16th street Mission Bart stop which will provide you with easy access to down town, East Bay, South Bay, and SFO airport. The number 22 bus line stops right outside our door. There are always a lot of Taxis outside due to the active nightlife in the area. Or you can always be sure there will be a Lyft of Uber nearby.

There is also a Cal Train stop at 22nd and Pennsylvania for access to the South Bay area. For trips around San Francisco we suggest using a ride-share service like Uber or Lyft.

"We highly recommend using public transit.  The Mission District has very limited parking.  We do not provide any parking for our guest cars   If you need a rental car, we suggest returning at the end of the day.  Trust us your life is much simpler without trying to find a legal parking spot."
"Since the Mission is very flat unlike other areas in San Francisco, it's easy to walk 10-30 minutes to access just about any food or culture you could want.  For accessing other neighborhoods, many bus lines are minutes away and the Bay Area-wide BART subway system is also just an 8-minute walk away."
"Muni & BART are both easy walking distance.  Easy walk, close-by, with no hills. It's only 1-2 blocks to several Muni bus lines. It's a 12 min walk to BART (at Mission & 24th) Zipcars are also within close walking distance."
"Super convenient for public transportation.  2 blocks to Church/18th street Muni stop (J line).  7 min walk to Bart stations (16th Mission St or 24th Mission St).  Otherwise, Uber and Lyft - never have to wait more than 5 mins for car pickup."
"Super easy access to BART, Muni, Zip Cars, etc. Also, extremely walkable to just about everything you might need. *If you have a vehicle, Shotwell is 1 hour parking only, or metered parking. Spaces are quite limited. Folsom and South Van Ness have more free and long-term parking options, but it of course is all first come first served."
"PUBLIC TRANSPORT 4 blocks from BART (24th st is the better walk), 20 yards to the Mission bus line, plus plenty of Ubers, Lyfts, etc, make it easy to leave the hood. Though with so much close by, we usually just walk! PARKING Parking is difficult in the Mission.  We do have a driveway, and it is possible to parallel park in front of our drive and block in our car.   Please note that this is not technically legal, and it is possible you may get a ticket.  However we do it almost daily and have only been ticketed twice in 5 years.  (It will be at your risk if you decide to park there, and the tickets run about $75.) Also, we have street cleaning from 6-8 AM Tuesday and Thursday mornings, so at those times you will need to park elsewhere. Usually it's possible to park across the street or around the corner.  Parking is a bit easier after dinner time hours or very early in the morning.    Other options are a paid lot around the corn(PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN) hours) or parking in the residential"

Just look up where you are going on Waze or other Mapping website and it shows walking, biking, public transport and driving directions and estimated times."
"Bart underground rapid rail system ( 24th st station) is located a block away to take you downtown, peninsula or east bay ( Berkeley).  Also a block away are buses and Mission St. is a main road for taxis"

There is ample street parking available on Dolores and some of the parking spaces allow all day parking, although most of the spots are 2-hr restricted except for weekends."
Everything is a short walk away.  Many buses and free shuttles stop within a few blocks.  The BART is a pleasant walk down 24th Street.
"We are near 16th Street Bart, 3 blocks away (9 minute walk) and the Muni Train is next to Dolores Park (8 minute walk). SFO and OAK are linked to BART; SFO is a 40minute BART ride from our apartment. There are lots of taxis and bus routes as well. We don't have a parking space because we are car free but there is metered parking on the main streets or free two hour parking in the residential area or parking garage on 21st and Valencia. We are on the 2nd floor, no elevator :( Flexible check in and check out.

Its about a 15 minute drive to get to downtown Union Square depending on traffic. My preference is Uber or Lyft - can get most places in the city for less than $10 - bargain!
"Close to lots of public transportation and you can Uber to the rest of it. No car  needed but if u do have a car, street parking is possible with some light effort. 10 minutes away to  the 101 highway if you  plan on driving to the game. 20 minutes away from SFO"

"Located two blocks from the 16th St. and Mission BART station, getting to and from the apartment and airport could not be easier.  We are also located a half a block from three major bus lines and the on-ramp to route 101.  There are also a number of car share programs in the area.

"Ideally situated in the Mission district, our place is a block away from the BART station, where a four minute ride will take you directly into the financial district and downtown. The exciting Mission and Valencia streets are on either side of the house, where an amazing selection of shopping, restaurants, and bars will keep you busy, day or night. San Fran is also the gay capital of the world, with the Castro only a 15 minute walk away."
"This property has a Walk Score of 92 Walker's Paradise, and a Transit Score of 100 Transit Paradise. Its two blocks from the sparkling brand new flagship SF Whole Foods at Dolores and Market Streets and the Church Street Muni Station (the train.) There's no parking with the unit. Use Uber and Lyft in the city. Rent a car when you plan to take a day trip to the wine country or Silicon Valley. I now rent/offer my own Prius on GetAround, thus you can rent it. You'll save yourself enormous hassle and its cheaper in total than parking garages and parking tickets (a tow away ticket is $500. Ouch!) People who live in SF rarely drive in the city."
Public transit options are numerous and there are typically Uber or Lyft cars available within 2-5 minutes for pickup. You won't need a car to explore the city from here.  16th and Mission BART: 0.5 miles Van Ness MUNI Station: 0.4 miles SF Bike Share Bikes: 0.4 miles

The house is just a few blocks from the Cesar Chavez exit off the highway 101, so the San Francisco airport is about 12 minutes away if there's not too much traffic.  This is about about as close as you can stay to the Peninsula, Silicon Valley and South Bay in San Francisco."

A shuttle service not sure on the price, maybe $ 20-25?, can be slow due to other people getting off at different address's, it will drop you at the front door   3. a cab, the quickest and the most expensive maybe $40 +, there are different apps ( Lyft, Uber) for cab/taxi services these  could be a little better deal than traditional cabs."

Again, the mission and many surrounding neighborhoods are very flat so it is easy to get around on foot. A quick walk to market street will also get you to the shared bike program where you can rent bikes for the day. There is also a SF guidebook on the shelf in the bedroom. Feel free to use this during your stay as it has great maps and suggestions."
"There is a bus stop across the street.  For routes search for ""511 transit"". The closest BART (light rail) stop is a ~14 min walk away at Mission and 24th St. The BART website provides train times. UBER and Lyft are probably the best combination of easy and cheap for getting around the city. Street parking is available in front of the house but requires a permit if you plan to leave your car for more than 2 hours during the day.  Unpermitted spaces are available within a few blocks.  It can take some time to find parking later at night, but usually not more than 15-20 minutes.  There is a nearby garage ~8min walk away where the car can be stored for $12 daily, search for ""san francisco general hospital medical center garage"" for more info.

The J-Church trolley is also just two blocks away, but it's pokier than BART. There is a public parking lot about three blocks away, but we encourage you to get around by public transit and ride-sharing services, or by walking.  It's easy!"
"The BART (aka subway, train, tube, etc.) is located at 16th and Mission. That's two blocks from the apartment and it will take you anywhere and everywhere in the city and in the Bay Area. You can also take the BART to and from the airport, the Embarcadero, Union Square, Oracle Arena, Oakland, Berkeley. There are also dozens of bus lines running through the Mission. Walking and biking are really easy from the Mission as there are no hills between this neighborhood and downtown."
"We are a block from the bus and about 3 blocks from the 16th and Mission BART(our subway) stop. BART can get you downtown, to the Embarcadero, to Oakland, and other spots around and outside SF in minutes. I take public transportation from my place everywhere I go outside of my neighborhood and I never have an issue. The bus can get you all over the city as well. Parking may be tough if you aren't used to the city. You can circle a while and find street parking, or there is a lot for $10/night on my street a few blocks away. From the airport you can hop on BART to 16th and Mission and walk 3 blocks to my place. This takes about 30 mins. You can also take Uber/Lyft and it will take about 20 mins and cost about $20."
"7min walk to BART station, 4min walk to Muni *Short walk to several other public transit buses!"
"2.5 blocks from BART, 1/2 block from buses. "
"Many bus lines within a few blocks radius. BART is a 15 min. walk or short bus ride away. Easy access to downtown, freeways (Silicon Valley), and airport. Street parking is restricted depending on the block (1-hr, 2-hr, 12-hr, street cleaning, no restriction). Check signs!"
"We're 6 blocks from 24th Street BART making it easy to get to/from the airport (with wheeled luggage) and downtown locations, including Moscone. BART travel time downtown is about 15 minutes. Easy freeway access (101 and 280) as well. Parking can be a challenge at certain times when soccer games are going on in the nearby park (but not impossible)."

City buses and regional subway system just a block or two away at Mission and 24th Street.
"We are two blocks away from the 16th St. Mission BART station. Lines 14, 49, and 22 are close by as well. We generally use on-call cars through Uber and Lyft.  There is free a, but competitive, street parking, metered parking, and also a parking lot right in front of us (about $20-$30)."

"The house is very close to the 24th Bart station, which will take you many other places. Then there's also many buses (12, 27, 48...) that will take you pretty much anywhere in the city. I personally love the bus, and recommend you to take it! However, walking around the Mission is very nice and it's walking distance from Soma, The Castro and Bernal Heights."
"AIRPORTS: You can take BART from either SFO or FROM Oakland airports to the 24th street station, and either walk 15 minutes or taxi to our house.  If you are adventurous, from SFO there is a much cheaper option that leaves you a few blocks from the house. Go on Airtran at airport to Terminal G, go to bus courtyard and get on Bus #292 (runs approx. every 1/2 hour). About 45 minute ride, get off Potrero and 22nd Streets. Walk west on 22nd to Florida (west is the opposite direction from the hospital), 4 short blocks. BUSES: There are plenty of lines that can get you anywhere. Stops 1 block away on Bryant Street and 22nd; 3 blocks away on 24th Street & Harrison; as well as other streets nearby.

We are 2.5 blocks to BART and 1/2 block from several major bus lines. 
"Okay, everyone is asking me about public transit:      It's a relatively small and dense city, the public transit options are plentiful.      To go longer distances, to cities in the East Bay, we take BART (that's Bay Area Rapid Transit) which is a subway.    It's a wonderful system, works very nicely.    My place is _right next to_  a bart stop.    It's also the easiest and cheapest way to get here from the airport.   From SFO go to the 16th and mission bart stop, and walk three blocks.     BART also reaches the civic center, mid-market, and ""downtown"" (financial district) areas on it's way to the East Bay.     There are also many bus lines which run around San Francisco, many of which run up and down Van Ness, which is one street away.     I am not personally very familiar with the bus system, although I'm sure it's fully adequate, because I bike instead.    San Francisco is not as big as some people might imagine.    Many (most) of the interesting areas are actually pretty flat and "
The Bart station is less than a 15 minute walk from the cottage. Numerous Muni bus lines are also walking distance. Uber and Lyft is also a great way to get around the city.
"We're only 14 minutes' drive from SFO, and one mile from the entrances to 101 and 280. We are 3 blocks from the 24th Street BART station, and easy 5-minute walk, and 1 block from several major bus routes."
you can borrow up to two bikes for excursions and honestly its the best way around San Francisco.
"BART (SF version of a subway) is very close and very convenient.  Parking is street parking only - this can range from easy and right out front, to driving around multiple blocks and praying to the parking gods. I'm thankful that my neighborhood isn't as bad as many in SF! Do read and heed street signs - there are street cleaning days and hourly parking limitations on some blocks."
"It's an easy and lovely 10 minute stroll to the 16th St/Mission BART Station, and there are Muni Routes all around us, so there's easy access to SFO, Union Square, Moscone Center, Market Street, the Ferry Building, Golden Gate Park, AT&T Park... Everywhere!  Our neighborhood is great for bicycling: Flat, with dedicated bike lanes on both Valencia Street and 17th Street. And we're both avid riders, and love to share the city's cycling secrets. (Trust us: You want to know about the Wiggle before you set off to Golden Gate Park.)  The 101 and 280 freeways are also nearby, but parking in our neighborhood is tough. (There is a parking garage three blocks away, ~$20/day.)"
"The BART (aka subway, train, tube, etc.) is located at 16th and Mission. That's two blocks from the apartment and it will take you anywhere and everywhere in the city and in the Bay Area.

"Easy commute!  Whether its within SF, East or South bay. We are 2 blocks from the 24th/Mission Bart stop, and just steps away from the 14-Mission, 49-Van Ness, 12-Folsom bus lines. Also, first stop off the highway for many tech commuter bus lines is right outside our door. Street parking is also available. On Fri & Sat nights you can park overnight on Cesar Chavez with no meters or time limits. Weeknights, parking on Valencia at a meter works if you leave by 9am. Also, parking just a few streets over in the Bernal Heights area is very easy, as they don't require permits and don't have meters."
"Easy access to public transportation (Muni Bus 9, 22 and 33 lines) with access to BART. Easy access from 101; street parking available (some restrictions)"
BART and buses are in very close proximity.  Walking and biking are great ways to get around as well.
"It is easy to get to most places in San Francisco from our home by public transportation, as well as to other locations in the Bay Area. A BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) station is located an eight-minute walk from us at 24th and Mission Streets, from which you have fast, easy access to downtown San Francisco. BART also provides easy and inexpensive transportation to San Francisco Airport, as well as to many locations in Oakland, Berkeley, and other cities in the Bay Area. Our home is also very close to many bus lines and a light rail line that can take you all over San Francisco. In addition, several car services such as Lyft and Uber offer fast and relatively inexpensive transportation around the city."
Buses on the street and 2 blocks from BART.  The apartment is located at the center of everything!  So it's great to walk and bike to places. Street parking. Close to major highways 101 and 280.
Lyft or Uber your best bets for local travel although the bus system and BART are close by and reliable
"The Mission is one of the most walking- and transit-friendly neighborhoods in SF. Getting around by public transportation (bus & BART) is faster and cheaper than by car.  There is no parking at our place and street parking is limited, but there is a parking garage two blocks away at Valencia & Bartlett."
"Great acess to the whole city, many MUNI bus-lines and trains."
"PUBLIC TRANSPORT We are near BART 16th St and 24th St stations, several Muni bus lines, and few blocks to the J-Church, and several streets with bike lanes.  We also have many taxis cruising the neighborhood. Uber and Lyft are also easy and great--if you are not familiar with these ride services you should check them out before you visit the city.  PARKING Parking is difficult in the Mission.  We do have a driveway, and it is possible to parallel park in front of our drive and block in our car.  We will need to coordinate moving cars if we need to get out. Please note that this is not technically legal, and it is possible you may get a ticket.  However we do it almost daily and have only been ticketed twice in 5 years.  (It will be at your risk if you decide to park there, and the tickets run about $75.) Also, we have street cleaning from 6-8 AM Tuesday and Thursday mornings, so at those times you will need to park elsewhere. Usually it's possible to park across the street or around th"
"We are a stones throw from multiple public transport lines. 24th Bart station is a 10 minute walk to/from our home. We are two blocks from the J-Line that runs past Dolores Park and takes you downtown, passing other neighborhoods along the way. Street parking is not hard to come by in our neighborhood however certain streets without a permit the car will need to be moved every 2 hours or so--double check the signs. There are definitely streets where the car only needs to be moved once a week. There are some parking garages nearby. From SFO you can Bart to 24th St stop--roughly 30 minutes. You also have the option of taking a cab, Lyft, Sidecar or Uber; price range roughly $25-45."

Incredibly easy to get to downtown SF, Oakland (and the rest of the East Bay), and to the Peninsula. Hop on a cable car or travel by foot and take in the charm of San Francisco. Many of the city's most popular destinations (Union Square, Chinatown, North Beach, Fisherman's Wharf, etc.) are within reasonable walking distance to each other. Ubers and cabs are plentiful."
"My flat is close to the freeways which makes a trip out of the city very accessible. It's also easy to access public transportation both MUNI (within SF) and BART (within SF and across the bay). You can catch the bus, 14 and 47 lines and underground subway easily, i.e. it is 2 blocks away. By BART you will be downtown in 10 minutes. If you have a bike, there are abundant bike lanes. If you like to walk within 30 minutes you can be on Castro, Hayes Valley, Haight, and other neighborhoods.  There is so much to see around Valencia Corridor and 24th Street, all of which you can do by foot (15 min). Just walking down Valencia is an adventure! And 24th Street has such diversity and vibrancy.  The 24th Street BART stop is 2 blocks away where you may want to take to go to the airport or downtown to Union Square, The Ferry Building, or the Financial District. A note about the homeless population: SF in general has a problem with homelessness. The City is working harder helping with this issue. "

Easy to get to Union Square, Moscone Center, Market Street, the Ferry Building, Golden Gate Park, AT&T Park... Everywhere! The Mission is also bike friendly and has numerous car service options. Street parking is a little more difficult to find and you must pay attention to street parking signs to avoid tickets, but a public parking garage is located one block away. Very bike friendly neighborhood."
"MUNI buses pick up two blocks away, BART line is walking distance. Zip-car and other options abound. Or bring your own car -- street parking is available."
"1. City buses often run 24/7 and cost $2.25, but nothing with $70/month Clipper Card (recommended if for expected heavy use).   2. Taxis & Uber certainly run 24/7.  3.

"Aside from one of the city‚Äôs sunniest microclimates, and delicious world-flavored foods, one of the best things about the Mission is that it is flat.

The BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) is accessible a few blocks down at 16th and Mission station, and can take you south to SFO, or north/east to downtown SF and plenty of other great places in the East Bay, like downtown Oakland (City Center) or UC Berkeley (Downtown Berkeley).

"Street parking can sometimes take a few minutes to find, but is available, and I usually end up parking on the same block as the house. Basically start on my block and then circle outwards concentrically til you find something. You want to keep an eye on the street signs that indicate what days there is street cleaning, which is when that side of the street must be clear of cars. If the street cleaning sign also says you need a parking permit, you can park there without a permit, but only for 1 or 2 hours. But most of the blocks near my house do not need a permit of any kind. The house is blocks from two BART (subway) stations and steps from the bus stop. That said, the best way to get around the Mission is to walk. The house is 4-6 blocks from the two main thoroughfares in the Mission, 24th St and Valencia St."

Parking is very difficult in the Mission as we are very popular for our restaurants and bars . We recommend not having a car when you come visit.

"A 4 minute walk from the 16th St. BART station Street parking is available (no garage or reserved space). If you're comfortable in a city setting, you'll find the street generally quiet with spaces available within a block or two. If you're new to driving in dense cities, it can feel strange or burdensome to have to park and walk but you'll find this to be a pretty typical experience within SF - few stores or restaurants have dedicated parking. The ""locals way"" to navigate takes parking time and city traffic into account, so my advice is to check public transportation routes (the apartment is 1 block from a BART stop) and bike routes (city bike share and rentals available) in addition to Uber and Lyft (which arrive super quickly in this part of town)."
"Take BART trains (10 minute walk) to/from San Francisco International Airport. Easy automobile access to Highways 101 and 280 and the Bay Bridge, 15 minute walk to the center of the Mission district, 15 minutes by bicycle to downtown SF. Typically easy parking within 1 block from the apartment."

Ask me though....local knowlegde helps. BART - is the SF subway - and it is 4 blocks away - best way to get downtown Union Sq, Embarcadero. Close Bus lines to neighboring city sections - Noe, Castro, Bernal, SOMA & Downtown.

You'll have to find parking but I can also point you to a lot if needed. San Francisco is also the center of rideshare startups. WIth Uber or Lyft, you can get anywhere in the city for under $7. There is also a Getaround car next door for $6/hour or $48/day. Basically, there's no need to rent a car."
-2 blocks to Bart (subway) -3 blocks to Muni Metro (street car) - 1 block to many Muni bus lines
"We're central to many bus lines to take you around the City. The local BART station is about a 15-minute walk. The Mission is exceptionally walkable and great for bikes as it's quite flat.

The easiest way to get reliable transportation info is still (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) Maps (yes, you can trust it on times and locations :) ).  I can also recommend renting a bike to explore the city (on Folsom street you are downtown within 20min). San Francisco is really bike friendly with many bike paths and fortunately the routes to downtown are all even (no crazy hills on the way, but if you want to go to other areas you will most definitely encounter some! ;) ) In case you rent a car, there is free street parking very close by!"

The parking is allowed for people without residential stickers from 6pm to 8am the next day. ie. only 2 hour parking M-F without a residential sticker.  On weekends there is no restriction - so if you park after 6pm on Friday, you should be good for the whole weekend :) There are several parking garages within a 10 minute walk to my place if you prefer that. I uberpool or lyft line most places - but there are also several muni (bus) lines all around my building and should take you most places."

"San Franciscans walk a lot! The Mission is very accessible on foot, and walking down the hip and popular Valencia Street (2 blocks away) from 24th Street to 15th Street is a great way to pass by the many excellent eateries of the area.  Walking down 24th Street (1/2 a block away) you will quickly reach Philz Coffee and many of the neighborhood's best taquerias, bookstores, bakeries, grocery stores and restaurants.  The flat is a 5 min from BART- the City's underground high speed train and very close to many bus stops.

"Neighborhood is highly walkable and has lots of public transportation. You can walk to BART in 15 minutes. Several buses just 3 blocks away (you can even take a bus to the BART).  Car parking is not included in the listing (though we do have indoor parking for your bike). The SF General parking garage is just 1 block away, and you can park there for $12/day.

"Walking distance to BART, Muni bus, and plenty of Uber/Lyft/Taxis in the area at all times"
"We're super close to both MUNI and BART, which makes getting around the city incredibly easy. I regularly take BART to and from the airport, with a three-minute walk from the station to our front door. There are also multiple routes that can take you downtown, over the bay to Oakland, or anywhere you'd like to go in the South Bay. Unfortunately we don't have private parking, so having a car here is difficult. The street parking is always incredibly packed - I wouldn't recommend relying on that. But with such good transit options (and Lyft/Uber), I haven't needed a car in the year I've been here."
"You can easily walk roughly 1 block away to get to the 16th Street & Mission Street BART station, which connects to the MUNI station at the Civic Center stop.  You can easily take the BART train from San Francisco (SFO) airport directly to the 16th BART station, and then walk only roughly 1 block to the apartment.

"It's a 2.5 block walk to the 16th and Mission bart stop (easy access to airport, the East bay, the South bay, and downtown San Francisco/the Embarcadero). PARKING: Street parking in the area isn't bad; just mind the 2 hour parking limits during business hours and 1x-2x/wk street sweeping schedule. **If you plan to leave your car in the neighborhood during your stay, LET ME KNOW AHEAD OF TIME and I'll leave one-day residential parking permits for you on the kitchen table that exempt you from the pesky 2-hour parking restriction. You'll need to scratch off the date that you're using it for and put the permit on your car rearview mirror - a new one per day. I pay $7/day extra for these, so leaving cash or (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN)'ing me @noelle-phares for the number of permits you take will be very much appreciated:) The alternative is paying $25+/day at a lot many blocks away so this is a cheaper & easier option for sho. **Still have to abide by street sweeping signs though!!!!"

Bart station is very close and the bus services is around the corner on 16 and Guerrero.

We are also located a half a block from three major bus lines and the on ramp to route 101.  There are also a number of car share programs in the area.  Parking is generally easy to find, though much of it is metered between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m."

"Public transit: Several busses run by our building, and the subway (BART) is one block away. Busses run 24 hours and BART is closed from 12-4am.  If you're driving: We are two blocks away from the 101 freeway. There is no parking in the building and street parking is difficult, so I'd recommend settling your car in one of the nearby garages (16th & Hoff or 14th & Julian). If you plan on staying mostly in SF, I would avoid a car - it's much easier to get around without one!  Not all of SF is accessible via public transportation, so Lyft and Uber will take you where you need to go. Happy to refer you to either service so your first ride with them is free!"

"Muni bus lines 9 and 33 stop on this block. 9 brings you through SOMA to Union Square and Downtown. 33 winds through the Mission and Castro, through Haight Ashbury, to The Presidio. One Muni transfer off either line will get you almost anywhere in the city.  BART at 16th & Mission and 24th & Mission are each a mile walk."
The location is perfect for walking around and using public transportation. There are MUNI bus stops steps away and there are 2 BART stops (16th Street and 24th Street) within a mile.  There is also plenty of street parking.
"The neighborhood is home to excellent transit (10 min walk to 24th St BART, multiple bus lines within 1-block) and is a great area for biking (no hills!).  The 101 is 3 blocks away which makes for very convenient airport access."
Bart and Muni are very close. And there's Ube(URL HIDDEN) Lyft and Sidecar.  Street parking only.

"A very short BART ride gets you to other great parts of the city (door to door 10-20 minutes) including the Moscone Center, Union Square, the Embarcadero, Chinatown, North Beach and we are walking distance (20-30 min) to Noe Valley, the Castro and Hayes Valley. Very easy bus or MUNI (train) connections will get you to the Haight/Ashbury, Golden Gate Park, and Fisherman's Wharf in about 30 minutes. However, San Francisco is a small city and the greatest way to appreciate it is on foot! My loft is located within easy walking distance to a ton of great restaurants and bars. The list is so long, but I'll be happy to leave a guide to all the best spots. It is also only about a 10 minute walk to the closest bart (subway) station. Just a sampler of great stuff within walking distance:  *Flour+Water (across the street) always a wait but a highly acclaimed Italian.  Great for late night meals! *American Grilled Cheese Kitchen (awesome sandwiches!) right on the corner. *Atlas Cafe - Awesome cafe"

"Many people ask if bringing a car or public transport would be easier. We suggest that single people use public transport (see below), if they don't mind walking. We advise people with (small) children to bring a car unless they are very used to walking.  Driving, parking and freeway access: We have easy access to 280 and 101, which make it easy to get downtown SF, the Peninsula, SFO & the South Bay.  Street parking is great near our house (which is rare in SF): although you must read the signs to avoid tickets and curb your wheels, as there are some minor restrictions during the day, which have not caused any issues for any of our guests. Directly in front of our house has some restrictions M-F.  Flood avenue, just out front, or Staples Avenue only have such restrictions once a week and are great streets to park on!  *Driving to Union Square, when avoiding rush hour and ball games, only takes 15 - 20 mins.

Bus #38 stops at the corner of Arguello and Geary and is a 24 hour bus, so you can stay downtown until the wee hours and still get home without the cost of a cab. Try Zipcar for a part or full day rental.  They include the vehicle, gas and insurance and you only pay for what you need. Or there is Uber and others like it that act as cabs at a fraction of the price.  And better service my guests tell me. Ride a bike to Golden Gate Park or the Presidio.

However, many neighborhoods have steep‚Äîmake that¬†steep‚Äîhills. In some areas the sidewalk is carved into steps; a place that seems just a few blocks away might be a real hike, depending on the grade. When your calves ache, you're that much closer to being a local. ‚Ä¢ By Subway:¬†BART is San Francisco's subway, limited to one straight line through the city. Within the city, it's a handy way to get to the Mission or perhaps Civic Center. BART is most useful for reaching the East Bay or SFO and Oakland's airport. There are no special visitor passes for BART; within town a ticket runs $1.85. ‚Ä¢ On Muni: All of SF ¬†Muni includes the city's extensive system of buses, electric streetcars, nostalgic F-line trolleys, and cable cars.

"The Garden Apartment is close to all forms of transportation. On-ramps to SF's two major freeways are minutes away, we're on the airport side of town, and the public light rail (train) and buses stop a block and a half from your door. The main drag through the neighborhood is flat and has bike lane markings.  The garden studio does not include parking. Free street parking is more available here than most SF neighborhoods, but that's not saying much. Tips: look for parking uphill of the apartment, and check street cleaning signs to avoid once-a-week ""no parking"" restrictions.  Past guests have had good experiences with Uber and Lift from the airport and to get around the City.  Much cheaper than cabs. Some guests ask if the neighborhood is safe. I've never had a problem. But,  because not everyone ""feels"" safe at night, I recommend exploring the neighborhood in the daytime. At night, use common sense in any neighborhood."

Also, when you park in our neighborhood (and San Francisco in general) you should curb your wheels to avoid a ticket, which you are subject to when parking on any grade 3% or more. Curbing your wheels means turning your wheels in such a way that if your car were to lose its brakes, it would roll into the curb."
Walking distance to countless restaurants and shops and a bus stop is steps away if you'd like to venture further around SF.

Best blend of ease/economy/security would be the SOMA Grand parking garage. Hours as follows. It's $2 per hour, $34 for 24 hours.

That's a 10-minute walk to BART and a 9-minute train ride. A Lyft or Uber to the airport can be $20-25 from here (actually, Uber has been $15 flat to the airport recently) or hop on BART for $8 each way (though be aware there's a hill to walk up with your luggage).  In general, if you have time to stroll, this is a super walkable neighborhood. We walk to the Mission District all the time (takes about 20 mins)."
"You can walk to and from the Glen Park BART station from our home. You can be in the middle of the City after a 10 minute ride on BART. Parking is free, but pay attention to street signs (street cleaning is the 2nd and 4th Tues or Fri of the month, depending on what side of the street) and you can't park longer than 4 hours M-F."

"Arguably one of the most convenient neighborhoods for living in the city! Quiet and safe, Glen Park is like a little suburban village within the city of SF. The BART is 5 min walking distance through lovely Glen Park Village and will take you to the Mission (great nightlife, vintage shopping, etc.), Downtown (Ferry Building, Union Square, Embarcadero, etc.), SFO, OAK, East Bay, and South Bay. BART spots are coveted in the city! It gets you to some of the most popular destinations in minutes, as well as all MUNI transfer hubs (MUNI is best for most inner-city destinations). Be aware, this neighborhood is not the most convenient for certain popular ""tourist"" destinations, like crowded Fisherman's Wharf (don't do it!) or the gorgeous Golden Gate Bridge (do it!), though Uber will take you there easily. The J-Church MUNI line is right behind the Glen Park BART station, and the 44 bus will take you straight up to Golden Gate Park in under 20 min. The freeway is also nearby and parking is goo"
The #35 bus that goes to Castro St station stops right outside the house and the #52 is a block away. Glen Park BART is about 10 minutes walk down the hill so getting around the Bay Area is easy. Highway I-280 is right behind the BART station so getting to and from SFO takes about 15-20 minutes .

Secure storage is available for bicycles, and free street parking for those who arrive by car."
"It takes 7 minutes to get downtown from Glen Park's own BART (rapid transit) station, and BART also services San Francisco and Oakland airports.

Bart is a 7-10 minute walk down hill. If you don't feel like walking back up the hill there is always a bus that runs through the village basically to our door. There is a bus stop right around the corner as well (there is one that takes you to Noe Valley and beyond and another that will drop you right at the Bart station). We are close to the interstate but you can't hear the noise of the traffic. There's plenty of unrestricted street parking.
"We are literally a two-minute walk from the Glen Park BART station (and the buses to (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN), Genentech and other Silicon Valley firms). It will take you just a few minutes on BART to get to the Mission, and less than fifteen minutes to get to the downtown stations. Many buses also service Glen Park.  And it is still very easy to park in this neighborhood, especially along Thor (the one-way street that abuts the cottage). Street parking is easy to find but beware that there is only 2-hour parking Mon-Sat between the hours of 9-5 if you don't have a residential sticker on the immediate streets. It's rarely enforced in this neighborhood, but you do risk getting a ticket if you leave your car all day. You'll need to move it by 11 am and then can park it again for the night a little after 3 pm. The other option, if you want to leave a car all day, is to park it a few blocks away, up the hill, where there is all-day parking. (See the area around Surrey Street.)"

It usually takes us 5 minutes to walk down to the BART station and 7 minutes walking back (uphill for 1.5 blocks).  We are a 15-minute drive from SFO airport during non-rush hours (about 30 minutes in traffic).  You can also take BART directly from SFO to Glen Park. Our neighborhood is safe, well-lit and pleasant.  From our house to the BART station you'll pass the neighborhood bakery, a cheese shop, gift shop, corner convenience store, crepe restaurant, a couple coffee shops, sustainable sushi restaurant, the local taqueria, a nice grocery store, a couple ATMs and a public library branch.   If you're up for a longer stroll, Noe Valley (yuppie haven) is 10 minutes away and the popular 24th Street shopping zone is a leisurely 30 minute walk away.  (All flat - no hills!)

The J-Church MUNI line is right behind the Glen Park BART station, and the 44 bus will take you up to Golden Gate Park in under 20 min. The freeway is also nearby and parking is good! There is a restriction on our street (4-hour parking Mon-Fri 9-5), but a couple blocks away it is easy to find 24-hour parking through the week -- I will direct you to these streets."
"Two blocks to the J-Church, which will take you downtown and connect with Bart. Numerous bus lines are easily accessible as well.

No parking permits are required and street cleaning is every two weeks."
"Ideal location for commuting to various parts of the Bay Area or exploring the City. A 15 minute walk to Glen Park BART station for a quick ride downtown, or 10 minute walk to J-Churn train line to the Castro/Mission. If you're venturing outside SF, easily access highways 280 and 101 to Silicon Valley or to Downtown SF / East Bay."

"Our street has plenty of parking, but only allows 2 hour parking Monday - Friday 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.  Glen Park is a transportation hub to other parts of San Francisco and the greater Bay Area.  1 1/2 blocks away, you can hop on BART to get to the downtown financial district, Union Square shopping district in just 10 minutes, or keep riding it to get across the bay to interesting cities such as Berkeley and Oakland.  MUNI bus line can grant you access to Golden Gate Park, Ocean Beach, Haight Ashbury, Castro, Mission, Pacific Heights, to name a few.  It's also a pick up destination for tech busses such as (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN), Genentech, Apple, and Microsoft.  If you want to stay in San Francisco but need to get down to work in the Silicon Valley, Glen Park is a great choice.  Of course you can always get picked up in a Taxi or Uber/Lyft for a nice night out on the town."

BART provides the most reliable, convenient, and fastest public transportation within SF (only minutes to the Mission district and downtown), the east bay and to/from the SFO airport.  MUNI and many buses also service Glen Park. Although parking is relatively easy in Glen Park, most streets have a 4-hour limit (Mon-Sat, 9am - 5pm) for non-residents.  You can avoid being ticketed if you move your car out of the area between 11am and 3pm.  With easy access to public transportation, including SFO, your best option is to avoid driving if you can.  Uber and Lyft also are always available and very convenient."
"Public transportation - BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) is .5 mile from our home. There are also many (MUNI) buses going to and from our neighborhood, but we prefer the BART subway trains because they are much faster.

Caltrain to the south bay is a 5 minute walk and freeway access to explore outside SF is also very quick and easy. Car services such as Uber and Lyft are readily available.
"PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IS VERY CONVENIENT FROM THE HOUSE. BUS LINES RUNNING DOWNTOWN ARE ONE BLOCK AWAY AND CALTRAIN WHICH RUNS UP AND DOWN THE PENINSULA IS 4 BLOCKS AWAY.  FOR THOSE DRIVING INTO THE CITY, THERE IS EASY STREET PARKING. "
"Well, bus 19 stops right in front of this place every 10 minutes! So public transport is super easy! You can get downtown/Union Square in minutes as well as connect with Cal Train and BART very easily. Also located a skip and a hop away from highways 101 and 280, which get you to SFO in 15 minutes or Levi Stadium in 40 minutes :-)! If you have a car, we have free parking available but there street parking is generally easy in the area with few restrictions. Parking Tip: Make sure to turn your wheels towards the curb when parking on a hill in San Francisco! You can also easily get an Uber, Lyft and Sidecar from this location."
"CAR // San Francisco airport (SFO) is less than 20m away. Both highways, the 101 and the 280, are less than 5 minutes away in either direction.

It's on Monday and Wednesday mornings on both cross streets (20th and Rhode Island). It is NO PARKING for 2 hour (either 8-10am, 9-11am, or 12-2pm).  The city never misses a chance to fine you on this type of parking ticket. It'll cost you $66 in money and even more in heartbreak :( BIKE // It's a great house to leave. In two pedals, you can go almost a mile in any direction. Coming home, you will probably have to walk the last 2 blocks. TAXI // These days, Uber is the easiest taxi to use in Potrero. Or SideCar.

"Bus lines on our bloc, Caltrain 10 minutes away,"
Muni and Caltrain stations are easily accessible.
"Parking is generally good on our street and parking permits are not required. However, no parking on Mondays between 9-11am for street cleaning. The MUNI bus system has stops within a few blocks of our house. This is a good way to get to other parts of the city. Uber is also a great option!"
"Take the Third Street light rail to points downtown including North Beach and Fisherman's Wharf,  the Ferry Building Marketplace, Chinatown, and downtown, and take the 22 Fillmore bus to the Mission and the Castro and points west.

"Close to Caltrain, buses, and in walking distance to the mission."
"I recommend having a car or using Uber/Lyft.  I rent my car out on GetAround - you can find it on that website under the name ""Potrero"" and rent it for the length of your stay.  If you have a car, I can sell you a residential parking permit for to park on the street here which is required M-F 8am-6pm and costs $20/day.  My car on GetAround is already permitted, so no need for the temporary permit. There is plenty of parking. There is a bus line that comes directly by my house but it takes a while to get downtown on it. I am about a 15 min walk to Bart subway, which takes you downtown. Using public transit, it takes around 40 mins to get downtown as compared to a 10 min drive."
"There are three different bus lines within one to three blocks of the apartment.  These can take you to tourist areas like, Union Square, Chinatown, Fisherman's Wharf, MOMA and Japan Town.

Biking is easy and almost completely flat along the water's edge all the way to the the Golden Gate Bridge. Finding street parking is relatively easy during the day, and very easy nights and weekends.  From the Airport: We are 12 minutes by cab or Uber from SFO.

"Download Lyft or Uber apps to easily summon a car. Muni, Bart, and Caltrain are easily access able from our home. We recommend downloading a smartphone app called Routsey or Moovit so you can easily navigate MUNI and public transport in the City. The app is easy and shows you when to get off a bus (or other public transport mode), distances, time, etc. Close to the 101, 280, and 80 freeways. The Caltrain station is a short Uber/Lyft ride away, it is on 22nd st in the dogpatch one neighborhood over.

"The flat is located on the #19 bus line, which provides transportation directly to SOMA, downtown SF, Hayes Valley, Civic Center, Russian Hill and Ghirardelli Square. You can walk to Dogpatch and the Mission, two neighborhoods filled with restaurants, bars and culture. If you are heading outside of San Francisco, a 20 minute walk will take you to both BART and Caltrain. It's also a quick Uber ride or drive to AT&T Park and UCSF Mission Bay."

"From the SFO airport it is easy and affordable to get a ""shared ride van."" Just follow the overhead signs until you are outside in the median. The vans should cost about $20 including tip. Because my home is so close to the airport, it is usually just a 20-25 min trip to or from SFO.   If you do rent a car, there is plenty of street parking right outside the front door.  For MUNI busses, the 19, 10, and 48 are all very close."

Walk to CalTrain in about 15 mins - which is your gateway into The South Bay and Silicon Valley.
"The only transportation here in this particular area, is the Muni bus or Zip Car.  There are several Zip Car lots here in the neighborhood.  If you prefer to drive but don't have a zip card, I encourage to get one.  It is easy but it does take a few days to complete the process.     We do not have an underground subway station within this neighborhood.  But San Francisco is a tiny city and is incredibly affordable to get around.  Uber's headquarters are literally a block away, so transportation will not be an issue."
"The T-Line is one of San Francisco's public transit lines, and there's a stop at 3rd & 20th Streets (1 1/2 blocks away).  From there you can get to  anywhere in the city, or in the bay area.

"The house is located near the geographic center of San Francisco, which means it's great for exploring many parts of the city on foot. Be warned though, this is a hilly area of San Francisco, so getting around often requires going up and over some hills. Great exercise and great views, but not for the faint of heart. However, if you'd like a shortcut it's only a short walk to Castro Station, where you can catch trains that take you all over the city. There are also multiple bus lines that stop within a block. If you have a car, you can usually find free street parking on the block."
"1 minute from our house you can find a Muni station. From there you can go downtown in 10-15 minutes taking any of the 6 trains that go there! Plus, there are buses and old-fashion trains that go through market to downtown. By Muni you can go to many different places like Castro, Ocean beach, Dolores park and more. Check it out here: (URL HIDDEN)"
"If you are arriving by car, parking can be found easily close by the house. The underground train is located in Castro and provides fast access (10min) to the Financial District. For a more vintage commute, use the F Market historic trams that depart from Castro and head strait downtown via Market Street. San Francisco plays host to a heavy competition between the world renown Uber, and the more local Lyft. These offer immediate pick up and drop off services that rarely exceed $6. If you don't already have these services download on your phone and using the referral codes below will get you free credit! (Lyft: ERIK358) (UBER: dm9fw)"

BART is also a fairly close walk (17 minutes, .9 miles) to connect to Oakland and the east bay. It's also a fairly quick and easy walk to Noe Valley, Duboce Triangle, the Lower Haight and on‚Ä¶ being so central, you may find yourself just meandering, exploring, eating and drinking your way across San Francisco!  Parking: - After several accidents and problems, we no longer offer garage parking.  - Street parking is generally easy to find on our block, and we have secured a complimentary visitor parking permit for guests with cars to use during your stay. Weekend afternoons can get busy and make it harder to find a spot.  Transportation from SFO Airport: A cab is about $55 plus tip.

Also you've got the historic F trains that take you to Hayes Valley, downtown, to the Ferry Building and Fishermans Wharf along Market -- so you can take in all the interesting SF sights.   The 24 Divisadero also goes along Castro (Castro turns into Divisadero going North) which will take you to the lower Height, hopping NOPA and all the way over to chic Pacific Heigths and then down to the Marina towards Chrissy Field.  Walking is always recommended though cause you will get a nice work out and really take things in!"

"The house comes with a driveway parking spot, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about street parking! The MUNI underground is only a 5 minute walk, which will take you to the downtown shopping district in only 6 minutes. In the same spot, you can find above ground busses and street cars.  Apart from driving and public transport, San Francisco has literally thousands of Uber and Lyft drivers and it is never more than about a 5 minute wait to have a car pull up at the front door. Walking in the area is safe and provides a great way to see the area ‚Äî in addition to being good exercise!"

"We live in the geographical center of the City, but it is about 35 minutes to Fisherman's Wharf and that related cluster of tourist attractions by public transpo.  There are many delightful neighborhoods, historic buildings, restaurants, shops, museums, and other attractions in the City. A city bus (33-Ashbury) stops at our corner.  We are a 10-minute walk from a Muni tram underground station and from the F line, which is a service made up of antique streetcars from all over the world that travel aboveground down Market to downtown, the Ferry Building, and the Piers and Fisherman's Wharf.  It is about a 20 minute ride on the underground to the cable cars at Powell Street.  Of course, the City is crawling with Uber, Lyft, Flywheel, and regular taxis.  Many of our guests rent bicycles to tour Golden Gate Park, or to ride across the Golden Gate Bridge.  The return trip is by ferry from Sausalito or Tiburon."

Uber: In order to avoid having to park and re-park all day, this app allows you to hail a cab and links your credit card for easy wireless payments ( and always arrives in under 10 minutes).  B. Next Bus: This is an app that automatically detects your location and gives your the nearest public transportation stops, departure/arrival times, etc. The public transportation system is incredible, and a great way to see the city. There are many modes around the city. I would suggest brining a lot of $1 bills ($2.25 bus fare for adults) or looking into buying a 3 or 7 day city bus pass here: (website hidden) "
"24 muni stops across the street, Castro Muni stop is 1.5 blks away and 16th and mission Bart is a 10-12 minute walk"
"We don't have parking, but in San Francisco really the best option is not to rent a car. Uber & Lyft are so efficient and public transportation also works great. There's a bus stop (line 15) feets away from the front door and many other only one block away on Market St."

"A bus runs immediately outside our front door, and a MUNI train is a half a block away (it will get you to Union Square, the Embarcadero or Civic Center). But we think you'll have more fun walking - you're within a 3-15 minute walk from the Castro, Mission, Market Street, Noe Valley, and Duboce Triangle. Did we mention it's flat?? A great place to adventure from. "
"Public Transit is a breeze.  The Castro Muni station connects easily to the BART and will make it a hassle free trip from the airport or downtown to hear and anywhere else you may want to go.  Honestly, everything is really just walking distance though.  It could not be a better location."
Street parking is always available if you have a car. Public transportation also close by.
"Overall, it is easy to get anywhere in San Francisco within 30 minutes or so at most.   There is no included parking space with the unit but street parking outside is very easy (a rarity in San Francisco).  I almost never have a problem finding parking right outside the apartment or very close. To get to downtown, just walk over to 18th and Church Street (half a block) and wait for the inbound J-line.  The trip should be about 10-15 minutes. The 33-Stanyan bus line runs directly on 18th Street which goes east to Upper Haight and west through the Mission and Potrero Hill.   Other useful bus lines are the 24-Divisadero (on 18th and Castro), and the 49-Van Ness-Mission (on 18th Street and Mission). Lyft is a great smartphone-based taxi alternative that is super convenient and fun to use. I am happy to answer any questions about getting around or places to check out."
"I am very centrally located. Near the J church line, and of course the K,L,M at Castro. The F Market is only a five minute walk up to Market St. Plus I am near the (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) buses"
"The J (which stops about a block away) will take you downtown; it also connects with other lines that can take you to virtually any part of SF.  The 22, 24, 33, and F all stop within 2-4 blocks of the unit and will take you to various parts of the city."

"We highly recommend walking as much as possible!

There is a bus-stop in front of the building. Close to all local transportation.
"These days I recommend to my guests that they use Lyft to get around. It's cheap and extremely efficient. You don't have to wait around for more than a few minutes once you order a car. With Lyft Line (picks up other passengers) you can get from place to place for about $5. So worth it! Plus, then you don't have to walk up the hill! If you don't have Lyft on your phone, I can send you a link that will give you a discount (I have a relationship with Lyft). This neighborhood is also very convenient for public transportation. The underground train is a 5 minute walk down the street (Castro Station) that can take you downtown in 10 minutes. Also there are the historic street cars which will take you to the Ferry Building and Fisherman's Wharf. My neighborhood is in the center of SF, making it extremely accessible to other parts of the city."
"We are in one of the best areas of town for public transportation.  One of the major streetcar lines runs directly in front of our house.  It can take you downtown in about 15 minutes.  There are many other busses that are only a few blocks walk that can take you to just about every corner of the city.  Many guests choose to use the ridesharing apps Lyft or Uber to get around quickly as well.  The BART trains can transport you to and from the two airports SFO and OAK very cheaply and quickly to the 16th and Mission station.  From that station we are a 4 block walk, or a quick bus ride on the 22 or 33 bus lines to Church street.  Unless you absolutely need a car to travel outside of the city, I would not recommend renting a car.  It is so very easy to use public transportation or even just walk around from our house."
The Castro subway station is a 7-minute walk away.  The 33 Stanyan bus to the Mission/BART Station or Golden Gate Park/Haight Street is right outside the door.  The 24 Divisadero line to the Fillmore and Marina districts is a 5-minute walk.  Car share and ride sharing is easily available.  Uber and Lyft apps can easily be downloaded onto a smartphone.

The 24 Divisadero bus line stops right at our corner. The Castro Street Muni station is located  just 5 blocks away. We are a little over 1 mile from the 24th Street BART station. See note below under extra details for information about parking.
We are just a few blocks from a large Muni (our subway/rail line) station that will take you around the city. Also walking distance to the famous F Market Trains.

A couple of blocks away from Church Station and Market Street. Four blocks away from Lower Haight which has several bus lines that can take you to Upper Haight or Downtown."
"Location and access to public transport are very important; there are two bus lines right on the corner, going downhill the 33 takes you to the vibrant Castro, the Mission district, Bart, and Portrero hill. Going the other way it takes you to the Haight (old hippy hangout), Golden Gate park and the Richmond district. The 37 bus downhill takes you to the Muni underground at Castro and Mission, the Castro, the Safeway on Church then back to the Haight."
"Public transit: The municipal street car/train system is a 1/2  block away and provides service to Downtown, the Embarcadero - Fishermans Wharf, the Beach and to BART for San Francisco (SFO) & Oakland Airports  The nearest BART station is  6 blocks.

"Muni Church Street Station will take you wherever you want to go! There are also a number of bus lines that leave form Market St If you don't fancy public transit SF has fantastic ride sharing, I recommend you download one or all of the following Apps: Lyft, Sidecar & Uber"
"We're literally 50 steps from the J-Church Muni streetcar line that takes you right down town (inbound) or to Noe Valley, Glen Park and the Excelsior Distric (outbound).  Take the J to the Ball Park, BART, Union Square, Financial District, Embarcadero/Ferry Building, Fisherman's Wharf, etc.   Of course, in San Francisco, Uber and Lyft are also popular.  We don't have a garage, but street parking is generally available. BART is about 8 blocks away and can be taken to SFO or Oakland airport."
"It's convenient to the Castro Station, which is a major MUNI train station.  It's about a 10 minute walk to/from the station. It's convenient to the F train, and the 24 and 33 buses as well. If you're a hiker, like us, there's a few short hikes nearby which give amazing views of the city: 20th & Sanchez, Kite Hill Park, and Twin Peaks.  It's about a 20 minute walk to the main restaurant strip in the Mission, and a hilly 15 minute walk to kid-centric Noe Valley."
"Walking distance to 24 Divisidero Muni bus line on Castro street, the J line Muni street car on Church street, and multiple Muni lines on Market Street."
"There is a mini bus stop on the same block, a 1 minute walk or less! BART train is an 11 minute walk."
"Location, location, location!!!!  You can get anywhere so easily from Duboce Triangle.  You have all MUNI lines at your access, including the F line trolley that runs up and down Market St.  You can either hop any MUNI to the Civic Center station to catch The Bart, or you can walk 15 minutes down 16th St. to the nearest Bart station.  There are also a number of buses that run around the area.  My personal favorite form of transportation is biking and walking."
It's incredibly easy to get around the city from the apartment. No need to have a car as we're near great transport. Ride a bike or walk to just about everything.  
"Walk to the Mission, Haight Ashbury, Noe Valley, and a longer walk to Golden Gate Park. Transit from here to most areas of the city is fantastic, and there's a lot you can walk to. But parking can be pretty difficult in the area (two hour limits during weekdays). Taxis, Uber, and Lyft are always ready to take you where you want to go.  Transportation To/From SFO Airport: - Taxi is about $55 including tip - BART (train) to the 16th/Mission Station - $8.60 one way - then a 5 minute taxi ride or a 6 block walk (0.8 miles; 15 minutes - a bit of an incline coming here from BART, a bit of a decline going to BART) - Shared vans (such as Super Shuttle) take many passengers to various destinations in SF - it may take longer, but will take you right to the door for under $20 Transportation To/From OAK Airport - I recommend BART from Coliseum/Oakland Airport to 16th/Mission Station - $4.15 one way - then follow the information above - there are other, pretty expensive options "
You really don't need a car here.   MUNI underground subway (Castro Station) is 30 second walk from the front door.
The apartment is a block and a half from the Muni train (N line).  And only a few block walk to the rest of the train lines on Church St.
"Public transportation is very easily accessible from the townhouse. The muni metro underground train is about a 5-10 minute walk, and the 33 bus is right out the front door, which will take you to the Mission and to the 16th St. BART Station. There's decent street parking nearby, so long as you watch the signs for permits and street sweeping. However, the best part about our location is how easy it is to walk to great spots. Of course, Lyft and Uber are available too and never take a long time to arrive and are cheap rides to most of the best spots in the city."
"The Castro is a transportation hub.  If you need to get there, there is a bus or train within 3 minute walk."

"The house is less than 1 minute walking from the subway Castro station (10 minutes to Downtown). Also 1 minute walking from the famous cable-car F line stop (yellow cable-car). Multiple buses around the are. Remember, you'll be a few steps away from the most famous intersection in San Francisco."

The shopping and tourist area around Union Square is just 4 train stops away (10mins), and if you feel adventurous and want to head to Oakland, you can switch to the cross-Bay train BART at Civic Center. Parking:  Street parking is generally easy to find in our neighborhood, but is limited to 2-hours during weekdays. Weekends are unlimited. Transportation from SFO Airport:  A cab is about $50 plus tip. You can take BART (public transportation) to the Civic Center stop (approx. $8 per person, one-way) and switch to MUNI there - from here you take the subway to the Castro Street stop. You can also just take a cab from Civic Center. Our house is on a hill and while the trek up Castro Street isn'"

MUNI's trolley cars and buses stop a block away and a BART station is a short walk, where trains go across the Bay to Berkeley and Oakland, and to the SF airport.

If you've never been here before, parking can be confusing and/or time consuming (make sure to read signs about street cleanings and hours)."

And at 17th Street across from the Muni Metro Castro station, the F line of restored antique rail cars takes you down Market Street ,the spine of early San Francisco, to the Embarcadero.  Here is the Ferry Building with numerous up-scale food markets and outdoor street vendors line the walkways. Take a ferry to Sausalito, Angel Island ,Tiburon, or even Oakland.

"The J-Church, our version of a subway train, takes you downtown and links you to all parts of the city. It's two minutes from the front door and you can connect to all the buses, trolleys and cable cars as well. BART takes you to and from SFO at a very reasonable cost.  Plus Uber and Lyft and cabs are plentiful in San Francisco."
"This house is surrounded by excellent public transportation options including the MUNI underground and buses. Surprisingly, there's also a fair bit of street parking, and a parking spot in our driveway is available to our guests that have small cars, when we're not home."

Cross town buses, like the 24 Divisidero, are just a few blocks walk away. If you need a ride, SF is home to super popular start ups like Uber and Lyft, and that means we have lots of transportation options.  Also, if you want to drive somewhere yourself, we have plenty of Zipcar and CarShare garages nearby."
"If you're driving, you'll be happy to learn that parking here is a breeze compared with most other places in the city - there are no meters or 2-hour restrictions, so you can park all day, no nearby businesses, so no crowding on weekends, and the only thing to watch for are the 2-hour street cleaning restrictions once a week on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays on different surrounding streets.  If you're car-free, the 33 Stanyan and 37 Corbett bus lines run very close - one stops a block down Clayton, the other stops just across Clayton on Carmel (walk up to Clayton and turn right, cross Clayton at the stoplights, the bus stop is on Carmel St.)  Also, the Castro Muni Metro (underground) line is about 6 blocks down 17th Street at Market and Castro, and it makes it super easy to get downtown on any inbound train, or to the beach, the zoo, or lots of other places on one of several outbound trains.

"One of the key advantages of our location is that a car is not needed; indeed we recommend to our guests who are traveling through California to consider foregoing a car during their stay as our building is located in a residential neighborhood but we are one long block (two short blocks) away from from historic street cars and the subway for traveling throughout the City.

"The J-Church street car stops directly across the street from the house, so public transportation is a breeze.  Depending on the dates, a designated parking spot can sometimes be made available should you need one."
Conveniently located 1 block from the bus and subway (MUNI) station.  Street parking is relatively ok (considering it is SF) to find and is free but is limited to 2 hour duration during the week.

Near 16th & mission BART Very close to 18th & church J line MUNI
Public transport is two blocks away.
Public transportation is within one block.  We are in a very accessible area for a MUNI/taxi/uber/lyft.  The 'Tech' buses pick up about 3 blocks from here.  This part of SF  has many bicycle routes that lead across the City. Garage Parking may be arranged for an additional fee.

Muni is right here and uber pool makes getting around too easy. Parking is also great!
Yes - 3 block walk to Muni underground
Bus stop is 150m away at the end of the road.
"Our home is located 3 blocks (a 5 to 7 minute walk) to the SF Muni Metro Castro Station. All SF Muni Metro lines, except the J and the N lines, run through Castro Station, so getting downtown or to the Financial District, Union Station, Civic Center, etc. is VERY easy using public transportation. In addition, the F train (an above-ground streetcar) leaves from its 17th and Castro terminus (also 3 blocks from the flat) every 15-20 minutes, and goes directly to Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf (Pier 39) via Market Street, downtown, and the Embarcadero.   BART is also easily accessible from the flat by taking any Muni line to Civic Center Station (3rd stop from Castro if on SF Muni Metro) in order to transfer to the BART.  Alternatively, the San Francisco Bay Area is the home and headquarters for both Uber and Lyft, and San Francisco has been called the epicenter of the ridesharing economy.

BART, from SFO airport and/or the Oakland airport, connects directly with MUNI metro.  In addition, there is a parking space available for a vehicle in front of the home.  Like many San Franciscans, we walk and take transit everywhere. The central location of the home enables instant access to the entire city from our front door."
Great access to public transport.
"Right off Market and Castro, it is fabulous for transportation and centrally located."
"The house is right on public transit: both bus and trains run within 1 1/2 blocks.  SF is a bike-friendly city, and bike rentals are available.  And everyone walks here, so a car is not necessary.  We're happy to guide you to and through public transit."
"We are in the Castro, which is in the center of San Francisco. There is a bus station a half block away, Muni station is four blocks away, and the BART (subway) is a short walk away.

"Very close to transport, and very flat to walk everywhere. Metro station a 4min walk away, BART station (16th) 10min walk. The historic F-line streetcar takes you straight up Market st, to the Embarcadero and Fishermans Wharf."
We're a five minute walk to three MUNI stops nearby. BART is a 15 minutes walk away on 16th and Mission. You can take the nearby MUNI to Caltrain which takes 15 minutes.  Parking is a bit of an issue in our neighborhood. There is free street parking about half mile north. Our immediate neighborhood requires a 'S' parking pass during the day (8am-6pm). Overnight street parking isn't an issue.
"The freeway isn't too far away, so you're 25 minutes from the airport by car.  Once in the house, Muni is nearby and you can catch a host of trams and muni buses from Market St to anywhere in the City."
"4 blocks from Muni, 1 block from a major bus line, and 20 minutes by car to the airport. Between two vibrant neighborhoods, it's only a short walk to Dolores Park, and a bit further to the heart of the Mission. This couldn't be a more central location for getting to know the real San Francisco."
"All within 1 block walk: Trains: J, N, M, K, L, Buses: 22, 37, 43, Streetcar: F.  Also everything is very walkable. It is very flat in my neighborhood too."

The castro muni stop is less than 2 blocks away and the 24 stops across the street.

"Subway (MUNI), Busses, Streetcars and taxis are all within a 4 block walk from the apartment at the corner of Castro and Market Streets.  There is never a need for a car within the city of San Francisco as public transportation is VERY good and plentiful."
"200 ft from J, which takes you to downtown. A couple of bus lines half a block away. BART is 15 mins walk away."

The 37 Muni line is right outside the front door of the complex. There is ample parking all year round as well.
There is free parking with the only block on Thursday from 9-11am for street cleaning.   There is tons of parking on alternate streets.
"We are a few miles from the 280 freeway, as well as BART and MUNI stations. The 280 can take you to SFO in about 20 minutes, Silicon Valley about 30 minutes, San Jose about 50 minutes and downtown in about 10. Similarly, BART can take you to the Mission District in 6 minutes, Powell station in 12 and Embarcadero in 15 MUNI light rail lines J, K, and bus lines (PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN), and the 14 (which runs all night), are short walking distances to make this location easy access to anywhere in the City and Bay Area."
10 minutes from MUNI station that connects to all other public transportation systems in the San Francisco area. And cabs/Uber/Lyfts are available within minutes.
"The 33 Muni Bus is minutes away and provides access to City-wide transportation including BART (subway), Muni, and the famous San Francisco Street Cars.   The Castro is a pleasant walk down-hill.  If you‚Äôre enthusiastic, the up-hill return walk is invigorating‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs a short and easy cab ride after a casual drink or dinner.  "
"If you prefer public transportation our house is conveniently located near the Forest Hill subway station. The K, L or M subway lines go directly to SF downtown."
"Two blocks from Muni bus line 36.  15 minute walk to the Muni underground trains, which makes getting downtown super easy.  Lastly, only 10 minutes from Hwy 280/101 so heading to and from the airport is painless, 20 minutes door to door."
"Convenient public transit, and great if you have a car as there is usually always ample free parking right out front."
"3 busses have stops within a block. The building rests above 24th street, and the 48 bus heads up and down 24th street into Noe Valley and the Mission and 24th street Bart station. Via a stairway Noe Valley and the Mission are a short walk and my weekend routine is to walk down the hill and catch the bus back up. There is also the 37 bus which stops right in front. This runs down to Castro and Market Street. Finally, there is the 52 bus which runs to Glen Park Bart station."
"2 blocks from Muni lines to the Mission and The Haight, and Inner Sunset. Walking distance to the Castro, Cole Valley, The Haight and Golden Gate Park. It is easy to Uber anywhere as it is the geographical middle of the City. Again, it is on the top of a hill for those without a car."
Take the #48 bus down the hill to Noe Valley or The Castro. The #37 bus will take you to Market to jump on a street car into downtown.
"You will be in the geographical center of the city, so within 15-20 minutes you can get anywhere from Ocean Beach to Embarcadero. And since it is SF you can take advantage of Uber (UberPool) and Lyft (Lyft Line) for cheap rides to your destinations. The bus stop is also next block which takes you to castro and from there you are connected to pretty much all underground muni lines. Also street parking is very easy in case you decide to rent a car."
"We're just a short .6 mi walk down the hill to the Castro MUNI Station where there is a wide selection of shops and restaurants. From there, you're just a 10-15 train ride from the Union Square, the Financial District and the Embarcadero. The 33-Ashbury bus stops in front of our house (no, literally in front of our house!), which you can take to Valencia Street, the Mission, and the 16th & Mission BART station from where you can go to to SF Airport and the East Bay. Take the 33 the other direction and you can get to Cole Valley, Golden Gate Park, and the Presidio."
"There are three bus lines that are near our house. The 48, 52 and 37. "
"Getting around our neighborhood is easy. With the click of an app you can easily download Lyft or Uber for hassle free commutes. For those looking to explore local transport - the 33, 37, and 43 bus lines, as well as the Castro Street Muni Train are all a few blocks away."
"Parking is free and not limited by street cleaning or 2 hour max (VERY rare in San Francisco).  There is one bus line that is about 5 min walk from the house, the #36.  Forest Hill Muni is about a 20 minute walk (although it is a decent sized hill coming back home) and this takes you to downtown SF in about 10-15 minutes."
"With a dedicated parking space an elevator ride away and easy access to Market Street, the entire bay area is 30 ‚Äì 45 minutes away.  For city travel there is a bus stop right outside the building.  Please look at the maps in the picture section to see how convenient my home's access is to city transportation.  It is a fun way to see the city and has the added benefit of avoiding the hunt for a precious San Francisco parking space."
"Yes, there is a bus (Muni #37) that runs from 5:30 AM- 11:30 PM. It's comes every 15 minutes at the BUS STOP right up the hill (1 min walk) and is quite punctual with its arrival/departure time as well! :) And you can always take a Lyft or Uber shared ride for as little as $5 anywhere in SF. :)"
"Public transportation is generally good and easily accessed.  See: (URL HIDDEN)  There is a bus stop across Romain Street at the corner of Corbett and Romain (just across from the corner of the house).  The only bus stop marker is a yellow stripe on the street (not the crosswalk stripes). This is the #37 bus -- which will give access (via transfers) to the entire city.  Bus fare is $2.25, seniors $100 and you must have correct change in coins or bills. You can download an application called Next Bus which you can use throughout the city to let you know busses near where you are and when they will arrive. If you like to walk the city is very accessible.  Remember, your return will be uphill.  You can walk from our house to the ferry building at the end of Market Street in about 1¬Ω hours (4 miles) all downhill.  This will take you through (or close to) the heart of San Francisco's premier shopping areas (Union Square area).  This said, the first hike you should take is to Twin Peaks.  (S"

And of course, the location is easily accessible to cabs, Uber, and Lyft.Less than a mile walk to the vibrant Castro, Cole Valley, or trendy Noe Valley.     1.5 miles from UCSF Medical Center, 4.5 miles from Union Square, 5 miles from fisherman's wharf--you truly cannot beat the location. If you prefer a mountain hike, the trail to the top of Twin Peaks originates right across the street."
"Public transportation is good in San Francisco, and as I mentioned earlier, I am located approximately three blocks from a bus stop, and about a twenty minute walk to the subway, or take the bus to the subway."
"Twin Peaks is located near many popular neighborhoods, such as the Mission, Noe Valley, West Portal and the Castro. Getting around the neighborhood is best done by car, but if you'd like public transportation the 37 bus, right at the end of Dawnview Way, will get you to the Castro in about 15 minutes.  The 48 at the bottom of Glenview will get you to Noe Valley and the Mission.  If you‚Äôre the outdoors type, you will love this area. Hiking abounds here. The Twin Peaks trails to the famous lookout with panoramic views of San Francisco starts right at the bottom of the hill (or take the back steps up from Crestline for a quicker walk).  Glen Park Canyon, a 66-acre recreation area, is a lovely nature hike to Glen Park village and the newly renovated Recreation Center that has two tennis courts, two baseball fields, and a playground. Or head up to see the cross and amazing views at Mount Davidson, the highest point of San Francisco."

"It's super easy to get around from here, because of our location on Bernal Heights, being near two connection points. We are 15 minutes driving to/from SFO if there's no traffic, 25-30 if traffic is heavy. We are also accessible to/from the airport on the regional train system BART, which goes directly into the International Terminal at SFO.

"From the neighborhood it is easy to get to San Francisco's downtown which includes the financial district and beautiful department stores, Chinatown, North Beach (known for Italian restaurants and the Beat generation hangouts), ballpark and other scenic destinations. But it does take some public transportation to get to these other areas. If you do not have a car, you will be doing a lot of walking, taking busses, and taking BART. I do this every day to get downtown to work which takes me about 25-30 minutes. Bernal is next door to the Mission district, with its wonderful shopping, eating and night life. It's also next to Noe Valley which also has some great local stores and restaurants. A cross-town bus stops just one block away. Or walk 7 blocks down to Mission Street and find three different busses. From there it's a short bus ride or 15 minute walk to the rapid transit (BART) to go downtown or across the bay to other cities like Berkeley. We are also very close to freeways to go so"
Muni and buses are within one block.
"There are quite a few public transportation options.

"The BART train goes right into the SFO Airport and will bring you down to the 24th/Mission station in about 30 minutes.  The walk from my condo to the BART station on 24th/Mission is about 12-15 minutes depending how fast you walk.  If you prefer not to walk, then there is the MUNI 67 Bus which starts out at 24th/Mission and come up right to Ripley Street and then over the hill to South Bernal Heights.  If you take the BART train from the Airport, and exit on 24th/Mission station, the Muni 67 Bus station is right there as you exit the BART station, across from the McDonald's side entrance on 24th Street.  BART will take you downtown in 5-7 minutes.  Heights if you feel the walk uphill is too strenous.    Be aware that parking is very limited in downtown areas so using BART and MUNI are highly recommended.  The cost of a MUNI bus ride is $2.25 for an adult and $1.00 for a Senior.

"MUNI is  on Mission St with buses that run all night (14,49) to downtown. BART is on 24th/MIssion St  (3 blocks) and takes you to downtown in ap 12 min."
"Close to MUNI, BART, Hwy 101, Freeway 280. Very easy to navigate the city from this location."
"The area has a Walk-score of 85 and not only is it easy to explore on foot, it's interesting. There are also several bus lines and the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) close by to take you downtown or out of the city with relative ease.  I also suggest Uber or Lyft which respond very quickly, and the freeway is moments away."
We recommend UBER or LYFT.  Bus system one block away on Cortland St.  Driving we are right off of both the 101 and the 280.
"Public transit: The flat is just a 10 minute walk from Mission Street, where you can catch the 14/14L/49 buses, which come frequently and drop you off at 24th/Mission BART, giving you easy access to downtown, San Francisco International airport and East Bay.

The flat is also 10 minutes walk from the J Church muni that will take you to cool places such as Noe Valley, Dolores Park and all the way to downtown.  Bus 23 is 5 minutes away and will take you to ocean beach.  Ride Sharing: Uber and Lyft are a great bet for getting around the city without a parking burden. If you download these apps you can expect to be picked up within minutes for transport to your destination for reasonable fares. Parking: the street parking in the neighborhood is easier than many SF neighborhoods. You can expect to find easy free street parking if you would like to ren"
"There is easy access (walking distance) to public transportation, via SF Muni Metro or BART.  The 67 Bernal Heights bus takes you right to the 24th & Mission BART Station, which provides transport to most of the Bay Area! There is ample street parking and access to SFO via the 101 Freeway for your flight home."

"Very convenient, Bus 24 stops right in front of the apartment. This bus can get you anywhere you need to go in the city."
"Plentiful on-street parking available and parking available in the driveway of the house. Just keep an eye out for the street cleaning schedule (clearly posted on signs) to avoid a parking ticket. Easy access to the 101 and 280 to get you on your way to exploring the Bay Area. Hop on the Muni 67, which picks up two blocks from the house and delivers you into the heart of the Mission in 15 minutes."
The house is about 100m from the 24 and 67 bus lines.
"There are several bus lines close by, and ample street parking. To get from the airport (SFO) to here: 1) Take a taxi.  This will take 20 minutes, and cost around $35. 2)   If you have a smart phone, you can take Uber Pool.  They will take up to 2 people.  It would cost around $18 if surge pricing is not in effect. 3) Take a Shuttle.  For example, Super Shuttle charges $17 one way for 1 person, and $27 one way for 2 people.   4) Take public transportation.   Take BART from SFO to 24th and Mission $(8.50), and then take the 67 Bernal Heights to Folsom and Tompkins ($2.25).    Walk 4 blocks west on Tompkins, and turn left on Anderson St.   Alternatively, you can take BART to  Glen Park Station, in San Francisco ($8.25).  Then take the #23 Monterey bus ($2.25)  at the corner of Diamond St., get off at Crescent and Anderson and walk 2 blocks up."
Street parking is free and (usually) easy. But be aware that if you come back late you may have to park a couple of blocks away. Also plenty of public transportation--you can take the subway to and from the airport or to go downtown. Several nearby buses go to all parts of the city--the #14 to downtown and Embarcadero; the #23 to Ocean Beach and Zoo; the #24 to Castro area; the #49 to Fisherman's Wharf.
"We are one block from the 27 muni, which takes you straight downtown. We are a 15 minute walk or 5 minute cab ride from the 24th Street BART Station. Most of the time Uber arrives in less than 5 minutes. There is parking in the neighborhood, but it's all street parking. It's not too bad to park here, but you do need to be aware of street cleaning days and times (they are clearly marked with signs) and it can be tough to find parking late at night when everyone is in for the evening. About half my guests bring cars and it's fine, but the city is crowded and there's lot of traffic and it's hard/expensive to park around town. If you don't really need a car, I recommend doing without and walk/Bart/Muni/Uber around town.  ."
"MUNI is across the street; BART is a seven minute walk away; freeways 101, 280, both N/S, 1-5 minutes away; buses across the street; shuttles to Silicon Valley one block away."

"We're right off highways 101 and 280, so it's easy to get downtown, to the Bay Bridge, and all points south. We're only a 15-minute drive from SFO airport. Street parking is usually available on our block, and you are also welcome to park in front of our driveway. You can also use our garage. The entrance is narrow, but most cars fit. The Cortland Ave bus line will take you down into the Mission and the 24th Street BART station, which is about 10 minutes away."
"Public transportation is easy from the house. Muni/BART: The Muni bus lines #23 Monterey, #24 Divisadero and #67 Bernal Heights stops are nearby. You can use the buses to connect anywhere in the city or to get to BART, the Bay Area‚Äôs Rapid Transit. It takes 30-40 minutes to get to down town San Francisco by public transportation, 60 minutes to the beach, 45 minutes to Golden Gate Park. There is free street parking available, and there are no time limits. In the evening it can be difficult to find a spot, as it's city car parking. Be careful to watch for street cleaning signs (Moultrie is every Wednesday 12-2PM) and don't block any driveways! I will leave maps and books about San Francisco for your use."
"The J train (light rail) is a 5 minute walk and runs through the Mission and downtown. Uber/Lyft to the mission is around 5 minutes / $8, downtown is 10 minutes / $15. The closest BART station is Glen Park. You can walk there in about 20 minutes, or take an Uber/Lyft for around $5."

"We are close to public transportation like MUNI lines J Church, buses #24 & #14 & #67, and BART stations (Glen Park & 24th street). Free street parking in front of or very close by to the house is readily available. We have great freeway access for destinations such as Napa, Marin or East Bay. We are a walk to the mission and a combination of car + public transport to tourist spots like Pier 39, the Marina, Golden Gate, etc. We can help get you there. "
"We have an 88 Walk Score and an 80 Transit Score. Bernal Heights and the southern part of the Mission are easily accessible on foot. We're also close to several major MUNI bus lines which quickly link to BART.  In case you are driving, we're conveniently located near Highways 101 and 280 around the Bay Area."
"Unusual for San Francisco, there's plenty of street parking nearby. SFO is about ten minutes away by car.  You can also take BART to 24th Street from the airport, but the walk from there might be a bit much with bags.  We recommend taking a taxi from the airport unless you're traveling very lightly.   The 27 Bryant bus, which goes downtown, stops two short blocks away at Bryant and Chavez.  The (phone number hidden) and 67 also run nearby.  24th Street BART and abundant Mission Street buses are a fifteen to twenty minute walk.  Caltrain's 22nd Street Station is pretty close, but a bit far for walking (25-30 minutes)."
"The convenient MUNI 67 bus line stops right across the street and will take you to the 24th Street BART station in five minutes. BART will take you downtown in minutes. MUNI buses connect here to all points in the city including Golden Gate Park, Fisherman's Wharf, AT&T Park, all museums and city attractions. STREET PARKING IS REALLY EASY AND FREE ON OUR STREET! Just be sure to read the street cleaning signs and do not leave anything of value in your car. From SFO the least expensive option is a BART/MUNI ride which takes about 45 mins.  A taxi/rental car will take about 20 mins."
"24th Street BART is 12 mins away on foot. Access to the 101 and 280 is 3 blocks away. You are basically in the Mission, so the flat terrain and ample bike lines makes cycling a great option. "

They will take you all through Mission and down to Union Square and the Embarcadero, or up to Fisherman's Wharf. Just a few blocks up, you can also transfer to BART which goes to the East Bay (Berkeley/Oakland)."
"There is a bus on the corner that goes through the Mission District to BART (our subway). That takes you about 10 minutes. Or you can walk to BART in 15 minutes. There's another bus 4 blocks away that takes you downtown. And many more buses within a few blocks. Download the 511 SF Bay Transit App for up to the minute details. We are 4 blocks from the corporate buses to Silicon Valley. We are about 6 blocks from onramps to highways 101 and 280. 101 south will take you to the Peninsula and Silicon Valley and 101 north quickly takes you to the Bay Bridge. Highway 280 is one of the most beautiful urban highways in the country and goes south to Silicon Valley and within 5 minutes provides access to the dramatic Highway 1 along the Pacific Coast. 280 north gets you downtown in a few minutes - and downtown, Mission Bay, the Embarcadero, So Ma are all accessible by public transit or a car if you have one. Easy street parking (easy is rare in SF)."
"There is a Glen Park BART stop about 20 mins walking or a 6 min bus ride via the 23 bus line. You can also get to the 24th and Mission BART stop in about 10-15 mins via bus. However, Uber andLlyft operate in the city and are great ways to get around the city. If you have a car, there is free street parking. My roommates and I have not had any trouble finding a spot. It is not always right in front of our house, especially after 7/8pm during the week, but we typically aren't more than 5 mins away walking to our home."
"------------------------------------------------- We are only a 15 minute taxi or shuttle ride from the SFO Airport & very easy to find! The 101 & 280 Freeways are a 2 min drive from the house, just at the bottom of the hill, making it convenient to get a"

Several lines will take you to Golden Gate Park & the beach, Downtown SF. and anywhere else you would like to go.  If the bus isn't for you, and you would like personalized transportation, instead of a taxi we recommend you use Uber or Lyft service after downloading their apps if you do not already have them."

Great public transportation from and to airport  and everything that makes San Francisco great. Or a few blocks from city car share.
"There is easy street parking right in front of our house. It's a 4 minute walk to the nearest bus stop which will take you right down town.

"Just a few minutes away from the heart of the Mission by car or a nice leisurely stroll down the hill. You can just as easily jump on the 24 bus line to Noe Valley and the Castro, or take BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) downtown quickly and without the stress of finding parking once you get there."
"Glen Park BART station is 12 minutes walk, and two bus lines stop within a 3-minute walk."

There are more bus lines that run on Mission St. You can walk downhill to Mission St. to take Bus 24 down to Mission St. Easy to get to Bart or underground muni by taking a bus and taking Bart or muni after. Really easy to get around.  San Francisco is a small city. At one point I did not drive, I got around all by a bicycle which is another idea for more adventurous. Rent a bike (many locations about the city) and you will be faster then the bus. Yes, the house is on the big hill, but you can walk it up - great exercise!  If you have a car, there is plenty of street parking and no street cleaning or time limit that many neighborhoods have."

"SF public transportation is very convenient, and cheap. The nearest BART station is just under a mile away, and muni buses run within a few blocks of the house. The neighborhood is super, duper walkable. And bike-able. We have two bikes available for use during your stay, free of charge. We  do ask for a $500 fully refundable security deposit for each bike. Just let us know if you'd like to use them and we'll set you up. We are a 10 minute walk from BART and 5 minute walk from the 14 Mission or 49 Van Ness on Muni. For those of you who need to get downtown, the commute is very easy. As in most of San Francisco, I would recommend relying on transit and taxis, Lyfts, FlyWheel and Ubers to get around. But if you do have a car, you can usually find parking on the streets surrounding us."

"Getting around San Francisco using Muni (Municipal Railway) Directions for going downtown: Highly Recommended: Take the 24 Divisadero Bus on Cortland Avenue, by taking a right on Cortland and walking to the next street corner. The bus stop is at Cortland and Andover. Carry $2.00 with you in quarters or $ 1.00 banknotes, because there is no change given on the bus and exact amounts are accepted only on Muni. The bus will go through the Mission District and Noe Valley districts and ask the driver to drop you off on Castro and Market, in the Castro District.  The F train which is a fleet of antique street cars starts right there , on the corner of Market and 17th (Market, 17th and Castro all intersect).

Additionally, there are bike rental opportunities through Spinlister.  Like most San Francisco neighborhoods, parking can be tricky, but we are fortunate to not have residential parking requirements.  Just be mindful of the street cleaning days!

Freeway 101 and 280 are both bordering Bernal Heights so there is very easy access to the East or South Bay if you are driving.   Use the BART train on Mission & 24th street to get downtown in 5-7 minutes.  If you have a Smart phone or an iPhone, install Lyft or Uber to get a driver in 5 minutes or less.

"The bay to downtown cable car run is close by, and bus stop is one block from apartment.  Historic trollies run along Embarcadero to downtown."
"There are multiple public transport options; however SF isn't known for it's public transport. FROM AIRPORT: There is BART (the train) that goes directly from the airport to the Montgomery station. It takes about 30-40 minutes. Then it is a 10-15 minute walk to the apartment.... however.... we live at the TOP of a steep hill / staircase; so don't expect to carry three huge suitcases and not be sticky and sweaty. Alternatively, I prefer the shared ride services (LYFT and UBER) for getting around and from the airport. SHARED RIDE SERVICES: The best way to get around is via Uber or Lyft (download the apps). They offer Line (Lyft) and Pool (Uber) shared ride services super cheap for parties of 1-2 (usually around $5-7 per ride). Here are some discount/promo codes you can use for either to get some free rides: UBER: 66j5j LYFT: SANDEEP464307"
"Easy-peasy access to busses that take you to downtown and any BART stations. The cable car takes you directly to Powell St (downtown with allll the transportion connections). It's pricey BUT a tip from the locals: buy a clipper card. 99 times out of a hundred the conductor will not scan your card because 1. they assume you're a local and 2. our conductors are a surly sort and hate technology. Parking sucks. That's just a fact of SF life. We don't have a dedicated parking space, no in-building garage and finding street parking is like a scene out of mad max but with 100% less tom hardy. There are garages around here with good deals but I'm sure they'll be charging an arm and a leg around this time. Really would recommend not having a car, use Uber, Lyft or Flywheel instead. But there's tons of bike rental places and biking is pretty safe. Even if you don't usually bike, a ride down the Embarcadero is so worth it. But honestly nothing beats walking. Walk to Montgomery Bart is about a mil"

If you need to get to SFO airport or coming from it, you can easily hop on bart located 10 minutes away from where the apartment is.  It's a 25-30 minute one way trip."
We are centrally located in SF! We are surrounded by numerous MUNI bus and train lines.  The BART train is only a 15 minute walk away. We are a 5 minute walk from the historic SF cable cars.

"If you are driving you should use a paid parking garage.  There is a two hour limit to parking without a residential parking permit.  You can use a parking garage at 721 Filbert St. (one block away) for $30 a day.  The cable car runs in front of my place.  It's $6 (more for tourists).  Use the Muni bus lines or street cars for San Francisco ($2.25 with 90 minute transfers to as many lines as you need within that time period). There are several bus lines within a block to access the entire city.  I like to use the Moveit app to help me find my bus schedules and locations. BART is good for the bay area and limited areas of San Francisco (prices vary according to length of transit). If you are traveling from the airport BART is the most economical way to get to my place.  It's $8.25 from the SFO Airport to Montgomery station then one bus (the #30, #8, or #45 lines) for $2.25 to my neighborhood.  I live a block and a half away from the Washington Sq. Park stop."
There are buses just 2 blocks away at Columbus & Green or you walk down town to catch the BART or muni.  There are usually an abundance of Uber or cab drivers in the neighborhood.
"The apartment is close to public transportation and parking garages. We have some street parking permits available on request at $10/day, otherwise there is a 2 hour limit for vehicles offering without a permit. Finding street parking is surprisingly easy in our neighborhood."
"Buses are a common transportation in San Francisco and we have a stop down the hill from us. Unfortunately, finding a place to park is hard! Street parking with 2 hour limit is the rule around here.  There is a paid parking garage in close proximity to our place. On the weekend you can normally park wherever you find an available spot. "
Bus stops close by.
"We are close to the F line, and a number of city busses. The closest Bart station is Embarcadero, which is a 25 min walk. Most people who live in SF take Uber or Lyft if they're trying to get anywhere across town, like the mission district or sunset district."

"Street parking is relatively easy in the day, but after 6pm fills up and becomes difficult. Street parking is tricky because you may only park in a resident spot for up to two hours, after which, you will have to move to a new spot or risk being ticketed. You may park at any meter ($2/hour), but may only feed the meter for up to two hours at a time. There are a few nearby parking garage options, for about $30-35/day, where we can direct you to park your car. We would recommend that to the extent possible, you forego the car while here, as this is a very pedestrian neighborhood, relatively flat and easy to manage on foot.  In addition, bus lines and public transportation abound here, as well as taxis and rideshares (Uber, Lyft); you should be able to get anywhere in the city from here. Buses are $2.25 (exact change required), and $1.00 for seniors/youths. Children ride free. We are happy to help guide/direct you upon check-in for wherever you need to go."

But don't worry - the immediate neighborhood is so great, safe, and well lit, you may find you won't be straying very far!"

Street parking can be very tricky, especially at night. There is a 2 hour max stay per spot without a permit during the day. If driving into the city, I'd recommend parking in a garage a couple blocks away for $20-30 per night.  To note: Cars are definitely not needed in San Francisco!

It's super safe to walk around Hayes Valley as its well lit and tons of people coming from the restaurants and shops. I do it all the time. There are a couple bus routes that can take you into the financial district or Mission district. Uber and Lyft is always accessible form of taxi and very cheap ($5 to $15) Happy to suggest additional routes and answer any questions if you are planning to take CalTrain (4th and King) to South Bay.

Although close to public transportation, it is tricky from the airport and takes alot of time.   As a service to our guests we can assist you.   Transportation to and from the airport is often times provided by the host for a nominal fee or they arrange UBER which can be added to your bill."
It's a quick hop downtown by bus or by car service! You can also walk downtown (about 25-30 minutes).
Bus Geary 38.
Public transportation is not an issue in this area. Muni is a 3 block walk and gives you access to the BART. Both easily take you around the city. There are also bus lines half a block away!

"Walk, run, bike. Bus lines 1, 2, 38, 38L, and 43 are nearby.   Taxi's or Uber cars are easily available. Parking is available."
"It's easy to walk around the neighborhood. It's also an easy walk to Muni, BART, street cars, or buses. No car needed. Obviously taxi and uber are a synch. If you do have a car, parking is usually quite doable on the street - and if you absolutely need a garage I can likely get you access to one just down the street."
"Two blocks from our place, you can catch all Muni lines (J, F, K, L, M, N) and head to Union Square (3 stops away) or the Ferry Building on the waterfront Embarcadero (5 stops). In the other direction, you can ride out to the Zoo or the beach (surfing lessons? bonfires?). There are also busses (one block away) that will carry you up to the cafes and boutiques of the upper fillmore and further on up to the Marina where you'll have the best views of the Golden Gate Bridge. Parking for a rental car on the street is free and surprisingly easy during the day, although there is a limit to how long you can leave your car in one place (2 hours). There are dozens of ZipCars around for day trips to Wine Country (Napa/Sonoma). Monterrey, with its famous aquarium, is 2 hours away, and Point Reyes National Seashore offers miles of isolated rural walks and empty beaches. You may get to see wales breaching off shore if you time it right."

"The SF Muni lines 38 & 38L run right outside our apartment and down the main thoroughfare of Geary Boulevard, taking you near Golden Gate Park and Ocean Beach heading West and towards Union Square/Downtown heading East. Also right outside of our apartment is the SF Muni line 22, which runs down Fillmore Street and will take you to the Marina heading North and to Alamo Square/the Mission District heading South.

"You cannot find a more convenient neighborhood to discover the city: if you need to go to the Financial District, Little Italy, Chinatown or to the piers, two buses (#6 and #7) drive right down the apartment up to downtown, and it takes about 15min/20min to go everywhere. The subway is also available at 5min walking at Church & Market, to bring you either downtown (10min) or straight to the beautiful Ocean Beach (20min). The same apartment street would also bring you to the Golden Gate park at it's very end (~20min walking)."
No need for a car. Bus lines and the ever popular uber and lyft are the way to go.
"There is a bus stop right 2 min walking away. It serves line 38 and 38R, going to Union Sq (eastern direction) and the Ocean beaches (western direction). The closes Bart station is Civic Center, 15-20min walking.  There is 2 hour free parking around the apartment compound from Monday to Saturday 9am to 6pm and no limits afterwards, besides Wednesdays due to street cleaning."
Close to several bus stops.  Very central for easy access to all tourist and downtown attractions.
"There's a couple of buses (the 21 & 22) that run just outside the house, but if you're going to anywhere within SF, try Lyft (sign up with code HAJE283604 for a $30 free credit) or Uber - they're both great for getting around.  There's no dedicated parking, and very little on-street parking near the apartment, so we recommend leaving the car at home!"
"Public transit is all around you. trains go downtown as well as out to the beach, busses go everywhere, the nearest downtown solution is the 21, which runs along Hayes, right next to Alamo Square. Or, if you're down on Haight st., the 7 works the same way. The basic concept for getting to and from downtown, is to get down to Market st. where ALL the busses run. The nearest TRAIN, which is different than a bus - goes both under and above ground, is the N. There are passes you can buy if carrying $2.25 seems like a pain, here is a map of all the locations to buy them - (URL HIDDEN)"

"The number 7 and 6 bus and the N Judah Muni line all get you downtown very quickly and the 24 runs from Pacific Heights to the Bayview just a block away. Buses to the Mission are just a few blocks walk, and Zipcar is very close by. We also have parking in the garage."
"* For those who want to hire a car, there is a Zip Car lot directly across the street.  * We're located on Oak Street and as such you have very easy access to public transportation, tech shuttles, HWY 101 & 280 and Downtown.  * There are buses on both Steiner and Haight Streets, a short 2 minutes walk from the front door * We are 5-10 minutes walk to all the action in Hayes Valley, Divisadero Street, and Haight Street where there are countless cafes, boutiques and world-class restaurants * There are a variety of parks and playgrounds for kids within a few blocks * There are various grocery stores within a short walk, including Wholefoods, Safeway, and Bi-rite."
"The Muni transit system's F and N lines, traveling down Market St. (San Francisco's main street) and serving multiple popular tourist destinations, including the Ferry Building and Fisherman's Wharf, have stops directly across the street from my building. The city's main subway system,  BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit subway), also has 2 stops within 1 km, and there are several bus lines are just a few blocks away.  To make getting around even easier, I have purchased a number of Clipper public transportation cards for my for guests to use during their stays. These cards can be used instead of cash to pay your fare on all of San Francisco and Oakland's public transit systems, and value can be added to them at BART stations, Walgreens, Whole Foods, and a number of other locations (as the new locations are frequently added, please see the Clipper Card's website for a full list).

Street parking is pretty good in the neighborhood, but I recommend public transportation, cause all parking is difficult if you go downtown.  Just take an uber or lyft from the airport."
Public transportation around SF is endless. It is the single best way to get around town. You can get anywhere in the city: BART/Bus/Trolly/Cabs. You can also do a lot of walking in this city. It lends itself well to folks who love to walk. (bring good walking shoes)
"I always recommending visiting without a car!  If you need one, rent it while you are here.  There are numerous Getaround and Zipcars nearby.

Our neighborhood is an UBER feeding frenzy!"
Busses are plentiful. I would say I have very easy access to the rest of the city. I am one block from 21 and 22 bus stops...and six blocks from BART. I would be more than happy to take a ride with you to show you how to get around if you aren't familiar with public transit. 
"Across the street is the 21 MUNI bus, and within blocks are the 5, 6, 22, and 71 buses. The subway is a 10-minute walk.

Cabs are plentiful too. There is only street parking, and it's very crowded, so I would not recommend bringing a car here"

"The 38 Geary bus is at the end of the block and will take you right downtown, Union Square, etc. It's kind of crowded and gnarly like most SF busses, but it's only 10-15 minutes. In the other direction the 22 Fillmore bus crosses the entire city from Marina to Mission.  You will have absolutely no problem getting clean and comfortable Uber, Lyft and Sidecar rides from here, usually arriving in under 5 minutes and costing $6-15 to wherever you want to go due to their ongoing price war. It's a short walk to  Lower Pacific Heights (Fillmore Street)/Japantown/Hayes Valley. I walk there myself all the time. If you are prepared for some urban hiking, NOPA, the Inner Mission, Civic Center and Mid-Market are not out of the question on foot."

Centrally located to public transportation.
"The Muni transit system's F and N lines, traveling down Market St. (San Francisco's main street) and serving multiple popular tourist destinations, including the Ferry Building and Fisherman's Wharf, have stops directly across the street from my building. The city's main subway system,  BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit subway), also has 2 stops within 1 km, and there are several bus lines are just a few blocks away.  To make getting around even easier, I have purchased a number of Clipper public transportation cards for my for guests to use during their stays. These cards can be used instead of cash to pay your fare on all of San Francisco and Oakland's public transit systems, and value can be added to them at BART stations, Walgreens, Whole Foods, and a number of other locations (as the new locations are frequently added, please see the Clipper Card's website for a full list). Lastly, if I will be available at the time you would like to go out somewhere, I am also happy to drive you in my"

"The transportation options for 246 Waller can't be beat! Muni is 2 blocks away ( right behind the Safeway) (Muni is the San Francisco subway and will connect you to numerous locations throughout San Francisco as well as link you to BART -Bay Area Rapid Transit- which can take you to the airport , the south bay or the east bay) The F train is the historic trolley line the runs down Market Street and the Embarcadero.

Yellow Cab ((PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN)) or Uber it.  It will take you roughly 15 -20 minutes in most cases and cost between $40-50."
"San Francisco is one of the most walkable cities (if you don't mind the hills) in the country, and this apartment is an easy stroll to neighborhoods like the Lower Haight (5 minutes on foot), the Mission (10 minutes), Duboce Triangle (10 minutes), and the Castro (20 minutes).  Public transportation offers many viable options for getting around, with close access to multiple bus routes leading all over the city. The Van Ness Muni (i.e., subway) station is five blocks away, and the Civic Center BART (i.e., light-rail) station is an eight-block amble.  If you're a fan of bikes, rentals are available at Patricia's Green, and the city offers a number of cross-town bike routes for exploring on two wheels.  (Street parking is available, but not recommended‚Äîspaces are limited and legal guidelines can be confusing for non-locals.)"
"One block from the 5, 21, & 24 bus.   Walk a few blocks east and you'll hit the 22 bus.  These busses will take you all over the city (Downtown, Golden Gate Park, Ocean Beach, Hayes Valley, the Marina, Pacific Heights, Castro, & Noe Valley).   Divisadero has easy access to cabs.  Lyft, Sidecar, & Uber are also plentiful in this area."
Muni lines 38 and 1 to downtown are within 3 blocks with easy access to downtown SF.
Central location near all public transit lines.

"We are close to 5 major bus lines that will take you, or connect you to anywhere in the City. If you are taking BART from SFO, you will exit at Montgomery Station and take #38 bus to Geary & Masonic (approx. 4 blocks from my house), OR take BART to Civic Center Station and take a taxi or Uber/Lyft (approx. $10. to my house). Personally, I take Uber or Lyft directly to/from SFO.  Fastest and easiest."
Our house has a walk score of 98--meaning you can accomplish 98% of what you need to on a daily basis without a car.  It is centrally located and served by numerous bus lines.  The 38 (which also has an express) takes you directly into downtown and Union Square in 10 minutes.  A great resource for public transit in San Francisco is Transit 511.  Street parking is relatively easy in our neighborhood.  There is a 2 hour limit from 9 to 6 pm Mon-Sat.
"Two blocks from our place, you can catch all Muni lines (J, F, K, L, M, N) and head to Union Square (3 stops away) or the Ferry Building on the waterfront Embarcadero (5 stops). In the other direction, you can ride out to the Zoo or the beach (surfing lessons? bonfires?). There are also busses (one block away) that will carry you up to the cafes and boutiques of the upper fillmore and further on up to the Marina where you'll have the best views of the Golden Gate Bridge. Parking for a rental car on the street is free and surprisingly easy during the day, although there is a limit to how long you can leave your car in one place. There are dozens of ZipCars around for day trips to Wine Country (Napa/Sonoma). Monterrey, with its famous aquarium, is 2 hours away, and Point Reyes National Seashore offers miles of isolated rural walks and empty beaches. You may get to see wales breaching off shore if you time it right."

"There are several great bus lines within a couple of blocks of the apartment:  line 5, line 22, line 21, line 24. The closest Bart station is Civic Center. PARKING:   Our neighborhood recently became a residential permit parking area.  That means you will not be able to park on our street for more than 2 hours from 9am - 6pm.  [In other words, you can park overnight if you move your car in the morning -- but, remember to check for street cleaning.]  Just a few blocks away, there are streets with no residential parking permits required.   This map shows where there is non-permit parking in the neighborhood:  (URL HIDDEN) You should also look out for street cleaning signs.

Cost one-way, plus transfers free for 1.5 hours: $2 (Cash or coins only!)"
"The area is served by several San Francisco Municipal Railway (MUNI) bus lines and it is a few blocks away from all of the MUNI Metro lines. The heart of the neighborhood, at the corner of Fillmore and Haight, is six blocks away from the subway stop of Church and Market, which is also the location of the city's largest supermarket, a Safeway. Surveys show that this neighborhood has one of the highest number of daily trips by bike per capita of any San Francisco neighborhood[citation needed], and walking is also very popular. The geography of the Lower Haight lends itself to the most efficient bicycle routing from the Mission District towards Golden Gate Park and surrounding neighborhoods, and the popular bicycle route termed The Wiggle zig zags through this neighborhood."
"Public transit options start within 1 block. The easiest lines to get to are the 47, the 49, the 1, the 2, the 3, the 19,  the 38, & the 38L.  Golden Gate Transit picks up one block away if you want to go north over the Golden Gate Bridge. And there's a Cable Car stop 2 blocks away. "

This listing is close to the highway entrance too, so getting dropped off by friends driving into the city is super easy.   Finding street parking is sometimes difficult, though rarely impossible.  There is no dedicated parking spot for this listing.  If you drive a car into the city you'll need to be prepared to move it by ~10am each morning depending on the regulations on that street.  Sunday parking is not regulated.  Some guests plan to drive to California destinations outside of the city each day, and this parking situation works for them.   You could also leave your car outside of the city and go carless while you're here! We love the San Francisco centrality of this location.  Hayes Valley shops are within 5 min walk, Mission is 15min walk, Whole Foods is an 8min walk."

The nearest BART station would be Civic Center, 1.8 miles from the house."

Taxis - I usually take uber or lyft lines, we also have yellow cab but sometimes they are unreliable. For the airport depending on peak hours I just take the BART at the Civic Center stop. Rental Cars - We have Zipcar and most major rental car services here, all are located downtown. Zipcar and Cityshare are scattered throughout the city."

Then the 22-bus line is less than a block away and can take you all the way up Fillmore Street to Pacific Heights (great shopping + dining on Fillmore), or down to the Mission / Potrero Hill and the east side of The Castro. Also, getting a Lyft or Uber is super easy ‚Äì we're within a couple blocks from their hot spot pick-up locations!"
There is a bus stop across the street which takes you directly to downtown and another route at the end of the block that takes you up to the Marina.
"Parking is available for $40 a night. Space is limited and is offered on a first-come, first-serve basis. If a parking spot is assigned, you will have access from your check in time through check out. If your parking spot is not vacated at check out time, you will be charged an additional day at the rate of $40.  If a parking spot is not available upon check in, there is some street parking in the area or there are multiple parking garages within a few blocks for a similar rate.  A car is not a necessity in this neighborhood as you are a short cab ride from everything, walking distance from many popular attractions, and close to public transportation including Bus, BART, and MUNI."

"Bus, Uber, Lyft, cabs, bike, walking, it's very easy to get to and from this place."
"Muni buses stop along the nearby Turk Street and Geary Boulevard can take you to downtown San Francisco, the Presidio, and much more. The number of bus lines within an easy walk are so numerous and so connected throughout the city that it doesn‚Äôt make sense to even list all of them here, but you‚Äôll quickly realize that you‚Äôre in the middle of San Francisco and can easily get anywhere with public transportation.  Or, you can always call an Uber or Lyft driver and have them pick you up in just a few minutes.  The apartment includes garage parking for one car, and SFO is about 20 minutes away."

Monterrey, with its famous aquarium, is 2 hours away, and Point Reyes National Seashore offers miles of isolated rural walks and empty beaches."
"# Walking Located in the middle of San Francisco, you can walk to all central neighborhoods. There's plenty to do within ~20-30 minutes on foot, but if you're going out to Fisherman's Wharf, or the Golden Gate Bridge, plan on a long walk (~1-1.5 hour walk -- we recommend Uber or Lyft instead). # Uber or Lyft Uber or Lyft are by *far* the easiest ways to get around SF. Both offer a significantly cheaper shared option (UberPool and LyftLine, respectively) that pair you with other riders heading the same direction as you, and usually cut the rate by about 50%. Riding across town in an Uber (or Lyft) will cost ~$12, and UberPool (or LyftLine) ~$6. # Public Transportation There are several bus stops within a block. Bus lines are typically numbered, and some also have a letter to indicate the type of service (For example, L = ""limited"" with fewer stops, but faster service to main stops, R = ""rapid"" with even fewer stops, good for longer trips but beware as it might pass right by the stop you"

Street parking is challenging. You may park for two hours on weekdays from 8 am until 9 pm. I may be able to provide a garage spot if your car is narrow. I have access to a freestanding garage very nearby but it is quite narrow (okay for the width of my MINI Countryman but nothing wider).
"The 38 bus line, only a 3 minute walk, is one of the main bus lines and it runs east - west across the whole city. the 22 bus line is also very popular moving north to south across SF. "
15 minutes from the 16th and Mission or Civic Center BART with a number of MUNI stops nearby.
There are busses all over the place
"Street parking available with several bus lines as close as one block away. Walking distance from several other neighborhoods like Nopa, Hayes Valley, Lower Haight, Japantown, and the Castro, among others."
N Duboce/Noe Street 21 Hayes St.  & Steiner St. 24 Divisadero St. & Oak St.
The best in the City.
"There is a very convenient bus stop across the street (the McAllister & Pierce Stop) where many of the major buses leave from. If needed, there is plentiful street parking on McAllister, Pierce, Fulton, and all the small side streets around our neighborhood."
"Public Transportation to downtown & airport:  Moscone Center:  taxi: 7 min, 2.3 miles. Muni: bus 5L or 5, 20 min. On Mc Allister  & Divisadero St Union Square:  taxi: 7 min, 2.3 miles.

"Walking distance to 21 Hayes, 5 Fulton, and all Underground trains at Van Ness Station, as well as BART at Van Ness Station."
The 5 and 5r are close!They will take you to the bay or beach! The 22 runs across the city opposite direction and will take you from the mission to the marina (you can catch it 2 blocks down on Fillmore)!
"San Francisco is one of the most walkable cities (if you don't mind the hills) in the country, and this apartment is an easy stroll to neighborhoods like the Lower Haight (5 minutes on foot), the Mission (10 minutes), Duboce Triangle (10 minutes), and the Castro (20 minutes).  Public transportation offers many viable options for getting around, with close access to multiple bus routes leading all over the city. The Van Ness Muni (i.e., subway) station is five blocks away, and the Civic Center BART (i.e., light-rail) station is an eight-block amble.  If you're a fan of bikes, rentals are available at Patricia's Green, and the city offers a number of cross-town bike routes for exploring on two wheels.  (Parking is available in the garage for one car, there is also street parking, but not recommended‚Äîspaces are limited and legal guidelines can be confusing for non-locals.)"
Close to Bart and all the transport options of Market st. Check the map -  we are in the middle of SF - if you don't like public transport an Uber will get you anywhere fast. Free street parking.
"Our flat is on 3 major bus lines, with express buses to downtown (express bus service during the morning/evening commute gets you downtown in 10 minutes with no parking hassles ‚Äî for the price of a regular fare). Have a car? Now worries. Enter through the automatic garage door next to our flat, and secure your vehicle in an off-street parking spot ‚Äî a rare find in San Francisco!"
"I'm really close to buses. I use uber and lyft a lot. I do not have a garage, but typically there's a lot of places for street parking."
5 blocks from Civic Center Bart...close to 21 Hayes bus line
"Amazingly convenient.  You can literally get anywhere from here with public transport.  There now are several apps that help you do it conveniently.  AND, it is a great walking place, all of SF is.  It is smart to wear good walking shoes in this city.  "
"The house is in a great location for public transportation.  Once you're settled in you can take the N train west to Golden Gate park or from the Church street station, all trains go northeast to downtown and the Embarcadero.  The 22 bus on the other end of my block goes north up Fillmore Street to Japantown, Pacific Heights and the Marina district.  From the house you can walk 10-15 minutes southwest to the Castro or  southeast to the Mission or northeast to Hayes Valley or west northwest to the Haight.  The famous Alamo Square and Painted Ladies are a direct 10 minute walk north.   I suggest walking and public transportation because parking and traffic in the city can be aggravating.  Street parking in my neighborhood is difficult and there is a 2 hour time limit during the day that is well enforced.  Lyft, Uber or Flywheel are very convenient and there are always drivers nearby - it usually takes just a few minutes to get one to the house."
"All Major transit (Muni, Street Cars and Buses) are within a couple blocks from the apartment.  BART is around a 15 minute walk.  Very centrally located and extremely easy to get around. No car needed, but if you have one, we can provide in-building parking for an additional fee of $20/night."

"Muni and bus stops within minutes, San Francisco is the home of uber."
"We are one block from the N Judah MUNI line which  runs downtown, to Golden Gate park and to ocean beaches.  Also one block from busses that go to upper Haight Street and Golden Gate park.  Best walking score in SF.  We are walking distance from many iconic SF neighborhoods: Haight, Mission, Castro, Hayes Valley and the up-and-coming NOPA neighborhood."
Simone is an Uber/Lyft driver and can provide transportation to and from SFO and around town. MUNI just 2 blocks from house.
"Accessible to multiple Muni lines. Street parking available and since the community is quieter, there are always open spots:)"

Just a few blocks from the N-JUDAH Train which will take you to AT&T Park for a Giants game or Caltrain Station. Or head the opposite direction to the Sunset for some awesome views of the ocean.  One block up is the 22-FILLMORE (the Dirty Douce!) which takes you to Mission, Potrero Hill or all the way down to the Marina for awesome views of Golden Gate Bridge.  The only place that's hard to get to is Fisherman's Wharf, oh well, take a Lyft!"
"This apartment is centrally located to San Francisco, and is a 5 minute walk to the Muni (subway). The Muni is the fastest way to downtown, the Embarcadero (Superbowl City), and connects to the Caltrain which provides transportation to Santa Clara for the game. Street parking is available, and if necessary, guests can park in the garage of the apartment."
Muni bus in 40 ft away. Muni train is down the block where you can connect with BART if you want to check out Berkley while you're here. You can get to anywhere from our central location. The apt is also very close to the 101 freeway for easy access to Santa Clara for the big game.
The Muni and Bart are a 10 minute walk.
"One of the rare neighborhoods where street parking isn't an issue, there are numerous places on the same block where ample parking is available. Additionally, there is a bus stop directly in front of the building where a bullet MUNI bus regularly operates trips to downtown."

A few blocks further is the N line train which runs west to Golden Gate Park and east under Market Street all the way to AT&T Park. The famous ""wiggle"" bike route cuts through the neighborhood providing the flattest route for bikes to get across town."
"The 5, 31 and 38 buses are nearby and the Muni bus system allows you to travel all over San Francisco.  As mentioned, there are also numerous bars, cafes, restaurants and shops within walking distance. Private car services are also available, including Uber and Lyft, but you must download the app onto your smart phone.  They are the most convenient way to travel around the city.  You can also get to and from the airport using these services and it‚Äôs usually cheaper than a regular taxi."
"There is a MUNI stop right at our corner as well as big stations within 3-4 blocks. Uber is a local favorite for transportation.   Whether you're arriving or departing from San Francisco International Airport (SFO) or Oakland International Airport (OAK), BART is a fast, convenient way to go. It also costs less than shuttles, taxis, rental cars or driving and parking. If you're visiting, picking up visitors or going on a trip, take BART to avoid traffic and save time. Plus, it's better for the environment. Arrive rested and ready‚Äîtake BART‚Ä¶ and you're there!"
"The flat is just 5 minutes from all the Muni light-rail lines and several city buses pass just a half block away. However, much of the city is a short walk from here: The Castro, The Mission, Hayes Valley, Haight Ashbury. Parking on the street is reasonably easy to find. On the north side of Haight street, there is no limit on how long you can park on the street."
"If you do want to explore other parts of the city, the 22 and 21 buses are nearby, or you can walk to Market for plenty of public transit (light rail, subway, streetcars, buses), or Uber/Lyft."
"The location has a walk score of 98, a transit score of 86, and the roads are great if you aren't afraid to tackle a hill or two by bike. This is city living. Parking can be a little tough, but, fortunately, you don't really need a car.  Several bus lines stop within 2-3 blocks so you can get anywhere. Lyft and Uber are very easy ways to get around. Download the respective apps on a smartphone and you can hail a private driver directly to you within minutes.

(You might use this to get to SF if you are coming into SF by Oakland Airport or SFO) Muni - is a in-city tram/streetcar. Its most helpful for traveling around downtown through to the Castro District.  I'd recommend downloading a app to help navigate bart/muni or the bus system if you are going to use them. There are a few apps in the appstore one made by the city is  (URL HIDDEN) There are airport shuttles you can also catch to get into the city, like supershuttle (URL HIDDEN)  But uber from SFO should normally cost about 45-55$ so I personally find this the b"

Easy to walk around our neighborhood and very easy to find parking due to the tennis club across the street. Uber is a great way to get around and bus lines are also within a few blocks from our home. We also have a parking garage space which we can provide access to for an additional fee.
Major busses are only 1 block away. I will definitely be happy helping you out to figure the public transportation. I can even walk you to bus stop if needed.

Bus runs directly in front of the house and one block away.
Walking distance to many muni stations and civic center Bart station.
"The Haight, Fillmore, Castro, and Duboce Triangle neighborhoods are short (15min) walks from the house.  There is an east-west bus line with stops at both corners of our block as well as a north-south line 2 blocks away. Those are simply the most convenient. There are many more bus lines within a 5 min walk.  There is also relatively easy street parking on the weekends, but this is restricted to 2hrs during the week, so if you are driving a car I can either help you with finding the unrestricted streets in the neighborhood or help with obtaining a temporary parking permit for your rental. Zipcar is also a popular option and there are 3 locations within close walking distance. Overall, I would advise against having a car in San Francisco - it is simply not needed and is an unnecessary liability."
3 blocks from the N Judah train with direct service Downtown and the Beach with connections to all parts of The City and simple transfer to both SFO and OAK via the BART train. Also serviced by multiple bus lines.
"GETTING AROUND: From our home, you can easily connect with public transportation (MUNI) a couple blocks away, hire a Scoot scooter, download the ride share apps (Lyft or Uber) or walk.

Almost all parking in San Francisco is 2 hour street parking or metered and you don't want to risk a pricy parking ticket."

The #31 bus stops literally at the front door so getting downtown or out to the beach is a cinch.  Otherwise it's a very easy walk to dozens of shops and restaurants on Divisadero or Golden Gate Park.  Uber and Lyft seldom take more than 5 minutes to arrive.
"This is one of the centers of public transportation in the city. Getting to the home from the airport is easy. Just take BART towards San Francisco, and, at Civic Center station, switch from BART to the MUNI ""N"" below-ground tramline. The closest stop is Duboce Park (it's also called Sunset Tunnel East). We do have two garage parking spots available at additional cost."
"Parking is usually available in the area, really close to public transit."
"Getting hear from the San Francisco airport is easy with a ride on the BART train to downtown, then catching a bus. Easy bus access means no need for a car.
